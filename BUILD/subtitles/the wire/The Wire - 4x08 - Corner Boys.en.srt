1
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:22,267
So, Rashad had 82 apples...

2
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:25,377
and 12 friends...

3
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,265
all of whom are hungry.

4
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:32,540
And so he looks carefully
at his apples

5
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,643
and sees that 7 have worms.

6
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:37,029
Another 15 have gone rotten.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,403
But he wants to be fair

8
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:42,428
and distribute all
the good apples equally.

9
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:44,124
Distribute?

10
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:46,098
Give out.

11
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:47,347
Well, just say that, yo?

12
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:50,167
OK.

13
00:00:57,994 --> 00:01:01,835
OK, so, how many apples does
each of Rashad's friends get:

14
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,135
A, 4;

15
00:01:03,803 --> 00:01:04,898
B, 5;

16
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,473
C, 6; or d, 7?

17
00:01:06,787 --> 00:01:07,907
or D, 7?

18
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,167
Take your time, but do it fast.

19
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,359
So, my boy said, "oh, yeah?

20
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:18,569
Well, he's a left go to right."

21
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:20,003
He was like, pow!

22
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,924
Calvin, you are done already?

23
00:01:24,602 --> 00:01:25,616
Yeah?

24
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:26,716
B, 5.

25
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:29,892
How did you work
that out so fast?

26
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:32,096
Easy.
"B, 5" got the dinks.

27
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:33,769
The what?

28
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:35,268
If you want,
I could show you.

29
00:01:36,552 --> 00:01:38,025
Don't show him, show me.

30
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:44,756
You did just what
the early math class, right.

31
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:48,305
So, you, like,
got 82 apples...

32
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:50,443
12 niggers.

33
00:01:52,135 --> 00:01:53,407
And then how many--

34
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,512
then you went, like,

35
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:57,802
dinking all round this one
and no other one.

36
00:01:58,183 --> 00:01:59,833
So, answer is "B, 5."

37
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:01,516
Everybody get that?

38
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:04,862
"B, 5," it got all the dinks.

39
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:08,523
"B, 5," I'm am Audi 5000.

40
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,008
4x08 Corner Boys

41
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:53,987
The priority should
be on making sure

42
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:56,834
the age files are up to date
with all notes transcribed,

43
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:58,347
the standard office report.

44
00:04:01,635 --> 00:04:04,470
On our day shift today,
you may encounter

45
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:09,036
councilman and democratic
mayoral nominee Thomas Carcetti,

46
00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:12,436
Who's been fact finding
within the department.

47
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:15,094
So, if you go leaving your fax

48
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:18,177
lying around and he finds them,
that shit's on you.

49
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,222
Lastly...

50
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,738
as most of you
are already aware,

51
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,183
our C.I.D. Commander
Raymond Foster,

52
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:29,122
after a long bout with cancer,

53
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,007
passed away last night
at Johns Hopkins.

54
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:37,249
Better eulogies are coming.

55
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:42,435
So, let me just say
that the man served 39 years--

56
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:45,465
attaining the rank of colonel--

57
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:49,282
without leaving a trail
of bitterness or betrayal.

58
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:54,386
In this department, that's
not a career, it's a miracle.

59
00:04:57,773 --> 00:04:59,654
There'll be a detective's
wake this evening

60
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,199
followed by
viewings on Wednesday

61
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:05,326
and a burial mass on Friday.

62
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,327
The family suggests

63
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:10,337
donations to the colonel's
favorite charities.

64
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:12,775
The addresses will be
posted in the coffee room.

65
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:14,091
All told.

66
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:18,104
And, Bunk, I just got
your overtime for the week.

67
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,237
Get down to my office
and pull your pants down.

68
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:41,964
Fuck that.

69
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:45,006
You've finished your pot,
you make the next one.

70
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,627
I don't see the right one
in here anyway.

71
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:58,059
Sergeant Hauk.

72
00:05:58,511 --> 00:05:59,611
Yes, sir.

73
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,884
I just got off
with Beauford at I.A.D.

74
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:04,537
He tells me there's a harassment
complaint been filed.

75
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:06,692
Some Jamaican woman
says you had her stopped

76
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:08,605
and searched by Amtrak police.

77
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,504
Well, you've see, in my report,
we had what we thought was liable info.

78
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:16,496
That she was a drug carrier
for Marlo Stanfield.

79
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:19,899
I mean, we actually
scoped Stanfield with her.

80
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:21,215
What was the info?

81
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,560
The C.I.'s been reliable.

82
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:27,247
Great track record with us.

83
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,979
Long history.

84
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:30,656
C.I. 238.

85
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:32,338
Give me his name.

86
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:33,305
His name?

87
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,711
Sir.

88
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:36,585
Sir!

89
00:06:36,644 --> 00:06:38,839
I've never been
comfortable with, you know,

90
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:41,922
tossing around names
of informants in squad rooms.

91
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:44,406
- I feel that it's--
- Name.

92
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,448
Fuzzie Dunlop, sir.

93
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:51,353
I might have to set up a meeting
with this character.

94
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:53,003
He's kind of leery of meets.

95
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:54,916
He's been reliable,
I promise you.

96
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,338
I mean, this one baffled
the shit out of me, too.

97
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:59,714
But he's never been off, never.

98
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:03,475
You jumped out
on bad information, Sergeant.

99
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:05,438
You brought in another agency,

100
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:07,657
and you brought
discredit to this unit--

101
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,202
my unit.

102
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:11,068
In good faith though, sir.

103
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:13,234
Anything comes of this,

104
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,016
I have your report,
and I will bury you with it.

105
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,533
And in case you haven't been

106
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,605
paying attention to
the election results,

107
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:29,175
your rabbi has
left the building.

108
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,216
No tantrums today?

109
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:38,722
What's the point?

110
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:40,506
They are not even gonna
suspend us, right?

111
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:42,069
Right.
What's the point?

112
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,501
So, we are here
like it or not.

113
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:48,579
If it makes you all feel any better,
the word around school is

114
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:50,705
you're down here because
you beat the system.

115
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:52,592
You had no interest
in being in a classroom,

116
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:55,017
and you made the classroom
impossible for everybody else,

117
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:56,342
and now you are out.

118
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,461
You won.

119
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,626
You feel like winners?

120
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:02,656
- Always.
- That's how we did.

121
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:03,953
Who's we?

122
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:05,940
Us.

123
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:07,373
No, who are you?

124
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,557
Players.

125
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:09,733
Kingpins?

126
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:11,325
Nah, that comes later.

127
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:13,072
Right now, we are
just corner boys.

128
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:15,139
So, how long until
you are kingpins?

129
00:08:15,282 --> 00:08:17,344
I am thinking two, three years.

130
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,416
Two, three years.

131
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:23,103
Let me ask, and I want
everybody to write this down.

132
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:25,776
Where do you see
yourself in 10 years?

133
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,216
Come on, pencil and paper.

134
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,710
This isn't schoolwork,
this is about y'all.

135
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,685
The young bitch is good.

136
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:39,155
Dr. Okenna from psych department
of college park.

137
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:42,709
Thesis work is on social
alienation and analysis.

138
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,506
All right, show of hands,
how many wrote "NBA"?

139
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:48,425
Yeah, but only
for the Lakers though.

140
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,288
I want to be a pediatric neural surgeon
like that one nigger,

141
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,489
what's his name?

142
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:55,280
- Len Carson.
- Yeah, that dude.

143
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:57,566
He's a black surgeon at Hopkins
with a lot of profile.

144
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:00,009
You want to be a surgeon,
you need to go to medical school.

145
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:01,157
Whatever.

146
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,606
How many wrote down "dead"?

147
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,616
Shit, you saw that coming, huh?

148
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,735
It's a shame you all have so little time,
and you wasting it here with us.

149
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:10,920
You know where you're going.

150
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,606
We can't teach you anything
you don't know about. Right?

151
00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:15,072
That's what we've been saying.

152
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,806
Naymond, put away the magazine.

153
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:18,673
I ain't reading no magazine.

154
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,058
Naymond.

155
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:22,173
What?
It ain't even mine.

156
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:23,921
It was laying here
when I came in.

157
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:31,329
You know, we are giving
them a fine education.

158
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:34,413
"It ain't even mine.

159
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,777
It was just laying here
when I came in."

160
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:38,413
You know this right here--

161
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:39,753
the whole damn school--

162
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:41,761
the way they carry themselves.

163
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:43,517
It's training for the street.

164
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,040
The building's the system,
we the cops.

165
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:49,102
Yeah, you are for sure.

166
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:51,754
I mean, you'll come in here everyday

167
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:53,123
and practice getting over.

168
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,406
Try running all
different kinds of games.

169
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:57,449
You know, it's practice
for the corner, right?

170
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:00,105
Ain't no real cops.
Ain't no real danger.

171
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:02,993
But you'll all getting
something out of this.

172
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:04,540
Bet you didn't even know that.

173
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:06,294
Still I'd rather be out there.

174
00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:09,549
Can I?

175
00:10:09,996 --> 00:10:11,173
Corner boys, huh?

176
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,593
Let me ask you'll something.

177
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:14,519
You help us hone in on this,

178
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:16,742
and maybe we do a little
better job with you in here.

179
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:17,973
What makes a good corner boy?

180
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:20,183
- Keep your eyes open.
- Keep the camera's trained--

181
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:21,244
Don't trust nobody.

182
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:29,574
If you stupid in the hood, you get killed.

183
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,107
That's the only way.

184
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,070
And I am telling you,

185
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:36,174
this name in black right here
got stink on it.

186
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,307
Eyeball witness, Bunk.

187
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:39,520
Vernon, at least go back
to the scene with me

188
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,574
and take a fresh look.

189
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,939
You're out of line here, Bunk.

190
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:43,086
You are.

191
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:44,539
A lot of names.

192
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:46,349
Too many.

193
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:47,979
No, we're good with it.

194
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,817
Listen, you back seat
driving motherfucker,

195
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:08,574
the guy picked them out.

196
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,781
Omar fucking Little.

197
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,862
Why he picked him out?
Who the fuck cares?

198
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:13,971
We got a dead female
taxpayer on our hands,

199
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,959
- and somebody's saying him.
- I don't buy.

200
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:17,309
And look who you talking about?

201
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:18,487
This ain't the motherfucker

202
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:20,574
that came up with
62 ways for the peanut.

203
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,793
His name pops up
on 5 or 6 cases I know of--

204
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,440
including two of yours--

205
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,327
and you want to put him
back on the street?

206
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,584
But this ain't him.

207
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,907
That means someone else
is walking on you all.

208
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:33,625
Let me tell you something, Bunk:
The next body you catch,

209
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:35,577
I'm going to be crawling all over it,

210
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,675
second-guessing your ass every step,

211
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:40,565
pulling on every last
motherfucking thread.

212
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:43,886
We going to see
how you like it.

213
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:50,095
Hey, Vernon.

214
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:54,247
- Just go back on it with me.
- What?

215
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:56,613
Shit doesn't play out
any differently...

216
00:11:57,711 --> 00:12:00,460
I'll give you a back rub
that you ain't never going to forget.

217
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,148
You guys don't need to do anything

218
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:21,041
you would normally do
just 'cause I'm here.

219
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:28,283
I wouldn't know
what we normally do around here.

220
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:33,602
I'm new and inexperienced.

221
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:35,590
Oh, you're--

222
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:40,443
I am.

223
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,152
Seriously, I'm just
trying to get a feel

224
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:44,116
for the department's
response to the violence.

225
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:46,198
And not the hall monitor
or anything.

226
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,878
So, this is your day?

227
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:18,637
We catch a body,
it's different.

228
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:46,367
- I believe you got my camera?
- I what?

229
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:47,682
License registration.

230
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,375
You do me one, I'll do you.

231
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,704
You got a card or something?

232
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:02,188
City, huh?

233
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,245
Video camera gotta come back.

234
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:07,963
Yeah, well,
I see what I can find out about it.

235
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,988
But you know cameras.

236
00:14:10,442 --> 00:14:12,162
Kind of like pictures in the storm.

237
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:13,687
You know what I'm saying?

238
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:16,782
Sometimes they come back.
Sometimes...

239
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:20,114
but I keep an ear out on it.

240
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:28,333
Pigeons, he just say pigeons?

241
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:29,991
He's fucking with you.

242
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:31,466
Look, you just got to tell Mello

243
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,960
that you used the camera for
the P.C. at the train station.

244
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,705
And then just submit
the camera got took.

245
00:14:35,764 --> 00:14:37,625
I already put it down to the C.I.

246
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,647
I told dickhead the truth.

247
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:41,209
He takes my stripes on it.

248
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:42,364
Oh, come on.

249
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:45,554
Look, I'm just saying
you weren't suspended that long.

250
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:47,572
Is it because tiff dropped it,

251
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:50,170
or because you had to do
something for Ms. Donnelly?

252
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:51,317
Do something?

253
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,697
I don't know,
like promise or something.

254
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:56,569
No, I just dropped it,
so it's dropped.

255
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:57,846
ain't nothing past that.

256
00:14:58,395 --> 00:14:59,573
That's good.

257
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:02,909
You know, the thing with the teachers
and cops and what not,

258
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:06,194
they always come at you like
think they got you by the ass.

259
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,174
But you keep your mouth shut,

260
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,588
ain't nothing they could do.

261
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,420
So, more times than not,
they go way.

262
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:13,933
Word on that.

263
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,085
I mean, I don't even matter.
and Ms. Anna--

264
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:20,009
she got me
on this short leash right now.

265
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,542
Can't go out the house
unless she know right where I'm going.

266
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:25,719
Shit, at least
you've got a leash.

267
00:16:38,202 --> 00:16:39,400
Dewey!

268
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,934
What the fuck is that?

269
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:43,855
Club soda...

270
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,424
and line.

271
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,891
Pensive bitch.

272
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:51,130
Why not just suck a dick
and get it over with?

273
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,611
That will get the bad
taste out of your mouth.

274
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:09,361
<i>I'm a free-born man of the U.S.A.</i>

275
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:30,881
Almost new.

276
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:32,977
Don't wear no dead man's hat.

277
00:17:33,044 --> 00:17:34,673
I'm just fuckin' with you.

278
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:36,512
Here, let's pray.

279
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:40,088
Here we lay a couple
of new York boys

280
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:43,642
who came too far south
for their own fuckin' good.

281
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,578
Fucking Yankee proud of it now,
you fuckin' bitches.

282
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,202
Leave the fucker to rot.

283
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:00,909
You hungry?

284
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:03,362
You want some Chinese?

285
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:08,541
No talking.

286
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:12,830
Keep your eyes on your paper.

287
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:22,483
- Yo, Mr. Pryzbo, this say cars.
- So?

288
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:24,746
All the stuff we did in
practice was about food.

289
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:26,986
It's OK.
It's just a different object.

290
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,859
Pay attention to the number.

291
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:30,329
Numbers are messed up, too.

292
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:31,821
We never did one-thirds.

293
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,278
It's the same operation.
1/4, 1/5, 1/3.

294
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:36,655
Follow the same steps.

295
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:39,848
- It's just a different denominator.
- How do you get 1/3 of a car?

296
00:18:39,946 --> 00:18:41,857
It's actually 1/3 of all the cars.

297
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:43,546
Was I talking to you?!

298
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:50,632
You get close enough...

299
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:53,143
you could take a head shot.

300
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:55,443
Why?

301
00:18:57,173 --> 00:18:58,724
This may be your best step.

302
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,512
Word.

303
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,746
A chest shot maybe
won't do it for you.

304
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,677
Then what? You.

305
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:08,078
It's his turn.

306
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:09,846
Thug, you got it.

307
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,957
You gotta shoot from a distance,

308
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:13,686
you can't risk a headshot.

309
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:16,757
You go for the belly,
the dick, or the ass area.

310
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:19,850
Because the vest
don't go down that far.

311
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,875
Bam! Take them out.

312
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:25,379
Then what?

313
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:26,512
Walk up,

314
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:27,846
finish them off.

315
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:28,985
With a?

316
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:30,584
Head shot.

317
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:34,209
Damn, y'all coming
along full effect.

318
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:36,212
I hear it--
I hear that.

319
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,845
All right,
now say he in a car.

320
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:44,759
Sergeant Thomas Hauk,
Baltimore city police.

321
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:47,041
Didn't I say city
would come running?

322
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:48,468
Did.

323
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,256
I'll checked his joker out for you.

324
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:51,673
See what's what.

325
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:53,781
One other thing,

326
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:57,978
You're are doing OK running them
New York niggers of off east side.

327
00:19:58,283 --> 00:19:59,445
I know that.

328
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:02,379
But this thing you got
with disappearing the bodies...

329
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:05,946
my man saying if you just
vanishing the bodies like that,

330
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:08,519
it do kind of defeats
its own purpose.

331
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,895
Niggers don't know if they went back
to the Bronx or whatever.

332
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:14,708
You feel me?

333
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:15,961
Of course.

334
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,680
I'll tell my people.

335
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:20,905
Hey, no disrespect to your
professionalism or nothing.

336
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:24,318
We all impressed how you lose
the motherfuckers like that.

337
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,477
We just trying to send a message
to these New York people

338
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:29,300
in full effect...

339
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:31,905
you know what I'm saying?

340
00:20:32,102 --> 00:20:33,674
I'll get back to you on this.

341
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:49,898
So, councilman,

342
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:51,902
I understand you were
a C.I.D. Yesterday.

343
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:53,747
See anything vague
with those downtown boys?

344
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:55,511
Well, they messed
up the lunch order.

345
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:58,506
I figured I needed to get closer
to the street, so that's why I am here.

346
00:20:58,546 --> 00:21:00,513
Rolling with the mighty
is east of the east.

347
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,246
Now, remember, we had
a shooting incident last week.

348
00:21:03,313 --> 00:21:06,058
So, keep those corner fucks
to one window. Don't get surrounded.

349
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,032
Shit, remember we had
a van full of you guys,

350
00:21:08,072 --> 00:21:10,297
- we'd find the fucking chap.
- What the fuck you say?

351
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,486
Dressed like that, Stevie Wonder
make you as police.

352
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:13,846
Keep your radio out of sight.

353
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,118
Volume up on those boom box.

354
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:17,146
10 bucks say we collar up first.

355
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:18,480
20 makes it worth our while.

356
00:21:18,546 --> 00:21:20,730
Mr. Mayor, you know
what's great about the Easter?

357
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:22,262
Real hungry motherfuckers--

358
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:24,035
respectfully, I mean.

359
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:25,413
So, you're saying,

360
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:27,752
you don't ever
give anybody a break?

361
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,583
Anybody?

362
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,313
'Cause if you let him
slide for a dollar,

363
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,780
it's a sign that you're weak.

364
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:35,380
Today's dollar is tomorrow's two.

365
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:36,780
Yeah, same with your crew.

366
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:37,923
Your boy come up short

367
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:39,912
saying spillage
or police or whatever,

368
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:42,643
you let him be,
and then he gettin' over on you.

369
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:43,704
Then you a chump.

370
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:45,317
So, you got to fuck him up.

371
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:48,034
You gotta, mess him up.

372
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:51,510
Something for real happen,
you do that.

373
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:53,547
If you do it over some bullshit,

374
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:55,387
then all you did
was lose a good worker.

375
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,724
Man, you gotta fuck
that nigger up, man.

376
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,892
Stop talking
on top of each other.

377
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:13,840
This how you communicating
out on them street?

378
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:15,314
All right, it's like this:

379
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:17,381
you boy come back to you, like,

380
00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:18,883
say this happened,
that happened--

381
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,161
Then fuck him up.

382
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:23,381
In my mind, I'm gonna let him
make it out of his own cut, too.

383
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:25,785
If you're good worker,
He know what you need to do.

384
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:27,447
Yeah, he got a point.

385
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,449
He got a point.
That's a good one.

386
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,214
If he thinks about it,

387
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,748
says it ain't his fault,

388
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:35,415
Then that nigger run a game on you.

389
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:37,080
And then you fuck that nigger up.

390
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,000
All right, yeah.

391
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:41,631
But why?

392
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:43,314
You know it gotta happen, man.

393
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:44,628
You know what I'm saying!

394
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:47,991
Wait, wait!
One voice. Y'all, one voice.

395
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,396
Yo, yo, D., you tell him.

396
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:51,359
There always people watching.

397
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:53,066
Watching you.

398
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,303
- True.
- Yeah.

399
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:57,124
<i>What's taking you boys so long?</i>

400
00:22:57,381 --> 00:22:58,614
<i>There he is now.</i>

401
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,581
<i>Hurry up, hurry up, this guy.</i>

402
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:01,826
<i>This guy right here.</i>

403
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,147
Fuck you, guys.

404
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:06,661
Yo, man, we need some pills.

405
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,592
Yeah, you in the right place, man.

406
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:09,673
Get them for us.

407
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:11,437
Come on, man,
I'm going to work.

408
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:14,366
Yo, 20 for the pills
and 10 for you.

409
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,790
Leave the bike.

410
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:17,080
What, you want steal my bike?

411
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,744
What the fuck I want your bike for?
I got a car.

412
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:21,747
Give me a minute.

413
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,681
<i>$20 might not mean nothing to you.</i>

414
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:30,215
<i>But I ain't making that much money.</i>

415
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:31,976
<i>It's hard money.</i>

416
00:23:33,183 --> 00:23:34,499
Y'all some lazy motherfuckers.

417
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,070
This shit is right around the corner.

418
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,001
You have no idea
how much we appreciate this.

419
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:40,364
I love it when they
come to work pumped like this.

420
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,499
Shit.

421
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:48,782
Come, man. I'm going to work.

422
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:50,615
Come, man.
I'm going to work, man!

423
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:51,782
It's bullshit, man!

424
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:53,448
This is some bullshit right here.

425
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,548
For real! For real!

426
00:23:54,615 --> 00:23:56,315
I ain't got no drugs,
no shit on me.

427
00:23:56,382 --> 00:23:57,715
I ain't got nothing on me, man.

428
00:23:57,782 --> 00:23:59,115
And you taking my bike, too?!

429
00:23:59,428 --> 00:24:00,482
I need that.

430
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,233
This is bullshit y'all be using!

431
00:24:02,311 --> 00:24:03,428
One down.

432
00:24:04,587 --> 00:24:05,805
<i>We got the money now.</i>

433
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:07,759
This is fucked up
right here, man.

434
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:13,908
Andre, how you doing?

435
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:17,878
This is a friend of mine--
Detective Moreland.

436
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:22,147
You doing OK there or what?

437
00:24:24,014 --> 00:24:25,689
So, listen, for my friend here,

438
00:24:25,827 --> 00:24:28,382
tell me one more time
how the thing went down, will you?

439
00:24:28,448 --> 00:24:29,806
The boy came in.

440
00:24:30,348 --> 00:24:31,382
Omar?

441
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:32,543
Omar.

442
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:34,782
He puts the nine on her.

443
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,628
Says to me, "whatever you got."

444
00:24:38,482 --> 00:24:39,707
A nine, huh?

445
00:24:41,475 --> 00:24:42,693
Where were you?

446
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:44,293
Where you see me at.

447
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:49,490
Nine wouldn't go through this.

448
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:51,445
Why did you come up?

449
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:52,761
'Cause he said to.

450
00:24:52,981 --> 00:24:54,362
Trying to save her life.

451
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:56,248
Right, I'm saying...

452
00:24:56,315 --> 00:24:58,917
this is like
vanca annealing glass.

453
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,155
Fort Knox glass.

454
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,249
And who put that up there?

455
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,863
Guy must have had
an elephant gun or some shit.

456
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:12,329
I don't know.
The boy had a mask on.

457
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:15,630
A mask?

458
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,144
Like Zorro?

459
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:21,727
When did that happen?

460
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:23,383
A few weeks back.

461
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:27,853
Put in a report?

462
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:29,149
It got away from me.

463
00:25:34,915 --> 00:25:37,922
We're going to need you
to come down to the office

464
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,716
and straighten out
a couple of things.

465
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:44,449
I'm running a business here.

466
00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:45,954
I ain't going nowhere.

467
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,151
Give me a bottle of mylanta.

468
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,177
Please.

469
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:03,516
His whole story
is fucked, and here's why:

470
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,758
first, it don't make any sense.

471
00:26:06,153 --> 00:26:09,855
The shooter took out the woman
and left him breathing to talk to you.

472
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:11,516
He should be dead, too.

473
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,931
Second,
there's a drug depot in there.

474
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:19,153
The glass, reinforced steel,

475
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,660
camera, low inventory.

476
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:24,816
And, third, he's shining us on

477
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:29,216
about that big-ass .50 cal hole

478
00:26:29,282 --> 00:26:32,177
because I know who put it there,
and he knows who put it there.

479
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:36,337
And if he were to say,
"Oh, that? That's Omar's previous.

480
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:38,593
Ripping off a re-Up in here--"

481
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,828
Which is what happened--
he be fucked.

482
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:42,447
So, what?

483
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,015
A guy comes in the first time

484
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:47,982
with a .50 caliber because
he knows the glass is thick,

485
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:50,402
then comes back the next
week with a nine?

486
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,150
The job isn't about
picking the stories we like best.

487
00:26:56,217 --> 00:26:57,295
Motherfucker.

488
00:26:57,353 --> 00:27:00,241
Now you are going to lecture me
about what the job is.

489
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,183
My apologies.

490
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,838
OK. Let's go downtown.

491
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:15,450
It's a new law, yo--

492
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:17,250
3 pills, that's felony weight.

493
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,450
And you're on a pre-indicted corner?

494
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,678
You better show some stash.

495
00:27:22,817 --> 00:27:24,377
Oh, it's off the chart now.

496
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:27,031
Those D.C. Boys down there, too, right.

497
00:27:27,183 --> 00:27:29,150
They love fresh Baltimore ass.

498
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:31,317
I ain't know no stash.

499
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:33,092
They say he's got a new pussy.

500
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,229
- Those my pills?
- Yeah.

501
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:38,903
Have you ever heard
of federal guidelines?

502
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,950
Pre-indicted corners, homeboy.

503
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:43,718
that's 3 years mandatory.

504
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,597
Unless you mitigate.

505
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,484
Mit-a-what?

506
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:50,283
Just stash, front boy.

507
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,750
I don't know no stash.

508
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,817
Those my pills, man.

509
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,584
I'm high right now, look.

510
00:27:58,162 --> 00:27:59,484
They gonna love him up in there.

511
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,517
Come on.

512
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:02,376
I saw him first.
Bitch is mine.

513
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:04,006
Those are my pills, I swear.

514
00:28:04,064 --> 00:28:05,242
That's two.

515
00:28:06,826 --> 00:28:08,260
Get the fuck in the car.

516
00:28:10,241 --> 00:28:11,450
Damn, fractions?

517
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:12,751
He's doing fractions.

518
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:15,517
Shit, you want to know what
we talked about in my new class today?

519
00:28:15,584 --> 00:28:16,877
- What?
- Slinging.

520
00:28:17,117 --> 00:28:18,484
Yo, I'm not playing.

521
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:19,916
We talked about business.

522
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:21,717
About putting shit
on the damn street.

523
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:24,305
- Nigger, please.
- It was that we schooling them.

524
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,034
Yo, my new class is the shit.

525
00:28:27,729 --> 00:28:28,923
You going by the gym today?

526
00:28:29,355 --> 00:28:31,646
No, man. I gotta go vial up
what's left on this package

527
00:28:31,705 --> 00:28:33,019
so I can re-up.

528
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:35,106
- All right.
- All right, man.

529
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:37,431
- Peace, man.
- That shit is easy though, right?

530
00:28:48,387 --> 00:28:49,847
I got to leave soon, Duquan.

531
00:28:52,852 --> 00:28:54,017
What level are you on?

532
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:55,104
12.

533
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:58,037
I never made it past 10.

534
00:28:58,112 --> 00:28:59,546
Want to see me get to 40?

535
00:29:02,694 --> 00:29:03,833
That's cheating.

536
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:06,820
Want me to show you how?

537
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:14,685
<i>Baltimore city police department.</i>

538
00:29:15,482 --> 00:29:18,150
Yes, ma'am, this
is Sydney Handjerker

539
00:29:18,229 --> 00:29:21,059
with Handjerker,
Kernan, and Bronburg.

540
00:29:21,457 --> 00:29:24,529
I'm trying to locate
a sergeant Thomas Hauk

541
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:26,518
in regards to a client
I am representing.

542
00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:27,897
<i>Hold, please.</i>

543
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,237
Mayor's office, Lieutenant Hoskins.

544
00:29:31,945 --> 00:29:34,136
Yes, hello,
this is Ervin Pepper

545
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:36,284
of Pepper, Pepper,
and Bayleaf.

546
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,752
I'm calling in regards
to a Sergeant Thomas Hauk

547
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:40,951
in regards to a--

548
00:29:41,017 --> 00:29:43,618
<i>He's no longer on this detail.</i>
<i>Hold on for a minute.</i>

549
00:29:46,682 --> 00:29:49,184
<i>Major crimes.</i>
<i>May I help you?</i>

550
00:29:49,251 --> 00:29:53,168
This is Dr. J. Calling with
test results for Thomas Hauk.

551
00:29:53,518 --> 00:29:54,718
He's on the street.

552
00:29:54,785 --> 00:29:56,646
You want to leave
a message on it?

553
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:07,761
Let's do it.

554
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:10,151
You just got to walk
up on him, all right.

555
00:30:10,358 --> 00:30:11,497
Snap one.

556
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:14,251
We gotta make sure
he from New York first, right?

557
00:30:14,318 --> 00:30:15,340
Gotta ask.

558
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:17,186
Ask what?
"You from new York?"

559
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:19,127
No, ask a Baltimore question,

560
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,183
something New York
nigger won't know.

561
00:30:21,223 --> 00:30:22,669
What's a Baltimore question, yo?

562
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:25,667
I don't know. Like,
maybe something about club music.

563
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:28,371
They don't know nothing
about that shit up in New York.

564
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:32,455
Ask him, like, who Young Leek be.

565
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:35,355
Shaking it, jiggle it.

566
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:38,633
OK, swift.

567
00:30:39,495 --> 00:30:43,678
Man! I know nothing
about that 92-cube shit, man.

568
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:45,380
Man, who gives a fuck, yo?

569
00:30:45,497 --> 00:30:47,010
You don't know Mark Clark?

570
00:30:48,522 --> 00:30:49,975
The b-5 morning show.

571
00:30:51,386 --> 00:30:52,655
You ain't right, girl.

572
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:55,216
The average Baltimore nigger
know all that shit, all right.

573
00:30:55,235 --> 00:30:57,536
They don't listen
to that shit up in New York.

574
00:30:58,385 --> 00:30:59,788
They listen bullshit in New York.

575
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:00,853
- Go ahead.
- Whatever.

576
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:03,452
Got a bet going on, men.

577
00:31:03,786 --> 00:31:04,819
What's up?

578
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:07,343
Who's your favorite one
on the big-5 morning show, yo?

579
00:31:07,422 --> 00:31:08,829
What, in new York, girl?

580
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,632
- Shawn zee.
- Who? Who?

581
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:11,786
Saw that show any day.

582
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:13,983
Snoop! Snoop, yo!
Snoop, yo! Yo!

583
00:31:14,022 --> 00:31:15,052
Chill!

584
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,844
Shawn zee be on the show, too.

585
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:27,437
So, maybe I ask the questions
from now on, all right?

586
00:31:29,963 --> 00:31:32,187
And then they basically
entrap some poor bastard

587
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:34,210
on a bet, haul in $20 worth of drugs.

588
00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:36,970
Now they got to process him, feed him,
property voucher his bike--

589
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:38,630
Next thing,
they are working on some...

590
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,654
14-year-old smoke hound
like he's Bin Laden.

591
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,053
The big haul there's
3 vials of cocaine.

592
00:31:43,092 --> 00:31:45,341
I mean, are you with this?

593
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:47,519
I've been fighting
this bullshit for years.

594
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:49,361
The only way to go
is high-end enforcement.

595
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,786
You pick the targets that
will make a dent out there.

596
00:31:51,853 --> 00:31:53,044
Reduce the violence.

597
00:31:53,332 --> 00:31:54,687
So, what's the problem?

598
00:31:55,452 --> 00:31:56,896
Problem is I do what I'm told.

599
00:31:57,052 --> 00:31:58,124
Meaning?

600
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:03,038
Mr. Mayor, I'm no more
a racist than you are.

601
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:05,403
Think about affirmative action.

602
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,026
I'm just talking policy here,
no offense intended.

603
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,304
None taken.

604
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:10,776
It's a numbers game.

605
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:13,596
And numbers games
breed more numbers games.

606
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:16,453
In your 20% hike in hiring
a black officer

607
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,118
to keep up with
the city demographic,

608
00:32:18,177 --> 00:32:20,546
that's also got to be reflected
straight up the chain.

609
00:32:20,644 --> 00:32:23,798
Which means fast-tracking
some people past where their--

610
00:32:24,248 --> 00:32:25,858
How do I say this?

611
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:28,111
Their experienced warrants.

612
00:32:28,397 --> 00:32:30,953
And he who owes his good
fortune to the numbers,

613
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:32,226
abides in them.

614
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:35,268
Gotta show arrest
are up 15, 20%.

615
00:32:35,862 --> 00:32:37,846
We'll worry about
the quality later.

616
00:32:38,002 --> 00:32:40,359
So, what you saw out there,
it's a con game.

617
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,687
A band-aid on cancers.

618
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:44,777
So, no, I'm not with this,
but I do follow orders.

619
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,985
However, if those
orders were to change?

620
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,710
Or if I had the opportunity
to change them myself...

621
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:08,418
Oh, no, you not!

622
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,387
What's this shit
doing in my house?

623
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,787
I stretching bottles, ma.

624
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:12,942
You ever see your daddy

625
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,139
bring his work home
with him like that?

626
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,644
That's what you got a Lieutenant for.

627
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:19,662
Police come to this door
instead of your mother,

628
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:21,925
they will have
this whole damn house.

629
00:33:22,286 --> 00:33:24,720
This all got to be packed up
and elsewhere right now.

630
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:26,440
All right, be cool.

631
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:29,053
Wait till Bell hear about this.

632
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:38,121
Did you hear that naked-ass
appealed racial solidarity?

633
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,487
I like to kick his pale, entitled ass.

634
00:33:40,553 --> 00:33:41,861
Were you listening?

635
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:44,532
He's no more a racist than I am.

636
00:33:44,913 --> 00:33:46,818
Might have to kick your ass, too.

637
00:33:50,357 --> 00:33:52,812
What have you heard
about his fellow Daniels?

638
00:33:53,187 --> 00:33:54,588
Major in the western.

639
00:33:54,654 --> 00:33:55,979
Yeah, he's there.

640
00:33:56,937 --> 00:33:58,312
Not much politically.

641
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:00,788
I don't think he's got
any suction with anybody.

642
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:10,089
Where's the rice-a-roni?

643
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,184
Ma, where's the rice-a-roni?

644
00:34:13,263 --> 00:34:16,429
There was this boy on the stoop
Looked like he was starving.

645
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,020
So, you cooked it for him?

646
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:19,591
No, I just gave it to him.

647
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:22,108
Just gave it to him.

648
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,336
Boy ate a raw box
of rice-a-roni?

649
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:32,830
How much did you sell
the groceries for?

650
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:34,628
Don't look at me like that?

651
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:37,613
I gotta go out.

652
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,410
10?

653
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:52,388
You have your rice-a-roni profits.

654
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,638
Martin, come on!

655
00:34:56,748 --> 00:34:58,693
Boy, I ain't gonna
let you hold the D.S.S. card

656
00:34:58,752 --> 00:35:00,518
if you ain't gonna do right by me.

657
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:02,755
You're gonna let me hold that card.

658
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:06,523
You a hard child.

659
00:35:17,551 --> 00:35:20,454
Next time, don't go selling
the food out of our mouths!

660
00:35:25,785 --> 00:35:27,054
Yeah, like y'all say,

661
00:35:27,121 --> 00:35:28,650
don't lie, don't Bunk,

662
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,946
don't cheat, don't steal
or whatever.

663
00:35:31,188 --> 00:35:32,681
But what about y'all, huh?

664
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,122
What, the government?
What, the Enron?

665
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:37,870
Steroids?

666
00:35:38,975 --> 00:35:41,671
Liquor business?
Booze the real killer out there.

667
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:44,021
And cigarettes--
oh, shit.

668
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:47,822
Hey, you got some
smokes in there?

669
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:49,059
I'm trying to quit.

670
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:53,941
And drugs paid your salary, right?

671
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:56,182
No, not exactly.
But I get your point.

672
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:58,456
We do the same thing as y'all.
Except when we do it,

673
00:35:58,515 --> 00:36:00,789
it's like, "oh, my God,
these kids is animals."

674
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:02,983
Like it's the end of the world coming.

675
00:36:03,155 --> 00:36:05,316
Man, that's bullshit, all right?

676
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:09,590
'Cause this like--
What's it-- hypocrite-- hypocritical.

677
00:36:10,288 --> 00:36:11,622
I mean, yeah, we got our thing,

678
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:13,868
but this is just part of the big thing.

679
00:36:13,946 --> 00:36:16,795
- Exactly.
- But this corner boy thing, right?

680
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:19,275
We know how y'all did
all this talking up in here.

681
00:36:19,373 --> 00:36:20,689
You think you could sit down

682
00:36:20,756 --> 00:36:22,332
and write down
the laws to your thing?

683
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:23,926
Hell yeah.
I'll doing it right now.

684
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:25,059
Shit.

685
00:36:27,122 --> 00:36:29,689
No, I'm talking about
can you'll do it together?

686
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:35,155
I give the test on fractions.

687
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:37,227
Half the kids have breakdowns.

688
00:36:37,704 --> 00:36:41,088
I still have a lot of kids
who can barely handle whole numbers.

689
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:42,509
Well, if it's any comfort,

690
00:36:42,823 --> 00:36:46,055
I have outside
of my advanced class

691
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:49,118
maybe half a dozen
reading at grade level.

692
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:51,563
Try having them on
the periodic table of elements.

693
00:36:51,602 --> 00:36:53,255
The thing is,
it's your curriculum,

694
00:36:53,322 --> 00:36:54,655
and you have to stick to it.

695
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:55,820
I can't. It's absurd.

696
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:56,988
You have to.

697
00:36:57,055 --> 00:36:59,051
That test in April
is the difference between

698
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,355
the state taking over
the school or not.

699
00:37:01,422 --> 00:37:02,568
Maybe the state should.

700
00:37:03,593 --> 00:37:06,822
Look, you teach math,
you teach the test.

701
00:37:07,114 --> 00:37:10,955
North avenue is all about The leave
no child behind stuff getting spoon-fed.

702
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,758
And what do they learn?

703
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,963
Find some middle ground.

704
00:37:15,472 --> 00:37:18,006
Every day try to do
a little for the statewide.

705
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,077
And keep a unit problem
on the blackboard for Donnelly.

706
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,466
You know, she comes to visit,

707
00:37:22,544 --> 00:37:23,921
she thinks you are on point.

708
00:37:24,227 --> 00:37:25,523
The rest of the time,

709
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,857
do what you feel like
you need to do.

710
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:29,156
But be careful.

711
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:31,889
You're are still on the far
side of your evaluation.

712
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:34,456
The first year
isn't about the kids,

713
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:36,427
it's about you surviving.

714
00:37:49,473 --> 00:37:51,162
Get up!
Get up!

715
00:37:51,723 --> 00:37:52,960
Hands on your head.

716
00:37:56,405 --> 00:37:57,953
- I was eating that.
- Fuck you.

717
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:00,189
- That's my lunch.
- Fuck you.

718
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,536
Find a wall, motherfuckers.

719
00:38:02,624 --> 00:38:03,822
Man.

720
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,819
Get your feet up.

721
00:38:07,112 --> 00:38:09,135
- This is harassment.
- What did I say to you?

722
00:38:09,294 --> 00:38:10,413
Fuck you.

723
00:38:11,597 --> 00:38:13,011
That's what you said to me.

724
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:14,398
There's nothing here, man.

725
00:38:16,113 --> 00:38:17,272
My bad.

726
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:18,832
Want to play games with me?

727
00:38:18,887 --> 00:38:21,156
Going to be in your people's shit
like this every day

728
00:38:21,312 --> 00:38:22,757
until my camera comes home.

729
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,126
You hear me?

730
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:25,639
Every day.

731
00:38:26,158 --> 00:38:27,415
You and yours.

732
00:38:28,323 --> 00:38:29,431
Let's go.

733
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,251
Ah, that felt good.

734
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:35,269
The old western D.E.U. rides again.

735
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,778
Yes?

736
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:42,887
<i>...All C.I.D. Reports</i>
<i>at the front desk?</i>

737
00:38:42,985 --> 00:38:45,777
<i>Any C.I.D. reports to</i>
<i>the front desk.</i>

738
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:47,823
Respectfully, sir,

739
00:38:47,889 --> 00:38:50,857
I would feel better if you clear this
through the chain of command.

740
00:38:54,392 --> 00:38:55,490
Yes, sir.

741
00:38:58,124 --> 00:38:59,462
I'll think about that.

742
00:39:04,758 --> 00:39:05,858
Problem with the bosses?

743
00:39:05,923 --> 00:39:07,086
One in particular.

744
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:10,241
That was our mayor-to-be.

745
00:39:10,424 --> 00:39:11,550
Carcetti?

746
00:39:12,724 --> 00:39:13,972
Seriously?

747
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,270
He wants to meet.

748
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:18,736
You and him, alone?

749
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:21,819
He wants to talk about
the police department--

750
00:39:21,898 --> 00:39:23,390
What works, what doesn't.

751
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:26,510
You have the mayor's ear now.

752
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,147
Look at you.

753
00:39:28,276 --> 00:39:29,791
Here's the thing--
What do I say?

754
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:33,225
- What do you mean, what do you say?
- How honest should I be?

755
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:36,724
I mean, it's one thing to talk
technical shit or enforcement strategies,

756
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,802
but the shit that actually goes on.

757
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:41,687
I start talking about that,
I don't know if I can stop.

758
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,676
Cedric, this is your chance.

759
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:45,617
This is a career.

760
00:39:46,643 --> 00:39:48,819
And what if I take my shots
at Burrell and Rawls

761
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:51,290
and he decides not to clean house?
What then?

762
00:39:51,357 --> 00:39:53,496
The new mayor calls you up,

763
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,419
Asks you for your take on things,

764
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:57,257
and you don't want to be,
what, a politic?

765
00:39:57,324 --> 00:39:58,643
Carcetti, oh.

766
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:00,624
I don't even know the man.

767
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:01,852
If he is calling you,

768
00:40:01,911 --> 00:40:05,112
it's because guys like Burrell
and Rawls are on the ropes.

769
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:08,591
Maybe.

770
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,224
I know there is a risk,

771
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,329
but maybe I'd fire away...

772
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:19,074
both barrels.

773
00:40:23,224 --> 00:40:24,890
Oh, wait out here, man.

774
00:40:24,957 --> 00:40:25,957
Up top.

775
00:40:30,524 --> 00:40:32,224
Oh, wait, oh, wait.

776
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,157
You got that grub,
you got that pot?

777
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,436
Oh, wait.

778
00:40:37,286 --> 00:40:38,865
"Shake it and jiggle it," yo.

779
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,270
Who made that track?

780
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,091
Yo, who you talking to, Dawg?

781
00:40:42,322 --> 00:40:44,423
I'm asking who Young Big be.

782
00:40:45,215 --> 00:40:46,425
You mean too fat's cousin?

783
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:47,592
- Who?
- No.

784
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:48,991
Nigger, how the fuck shit I know?

785
00:40:49,058 --> 00:40:50,642
Yo, who the fuck is you talking--

786
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:52,547
Oh, shit.

787
00:40:52,626 --> 00:40:53,592
Not bad.

788
00:40:53,658 --> 00:40:54,940
Fuck that nigger.

789
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,537
What up, B?

790
00:41:03,734 --> 00:41:05,599
- Where ma at?
- Upstairs.

791
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,626
Michael, my daddy came home.

792
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,458
Daddy came home?

793
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:17,195
Look who home?

794
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:19,059
Michael.

795
00:41:29,379 --> 00:41:30,636
Damn, you grew.

796
00:41:44,956 --> 00:41:46,670
And a pack of cools for Macy.

797
00:41:49,158 --> 00:41:50,835
Still tricking for that clown?

798
00:41:51,915 --> 00:41:54,592
You know, I don't understand
why people talk trash about him.

799
00:41:54,658 --> 00:41:55,859
All I know is he loves me.

800
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:58,959
Well, when you get tired of him
going upside your head and all,

801
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,910
you'll really know who loves you.

802
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:02,358
Whatever.

803
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:14,291
Motherfucker, what?

804
00:42:22,088 --> 00:42:23,482
He had 12 years.

805
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:26,055
Parole.

806
00:42:26,992 --> 00:42:28,517
It was only a drug charge.

807
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:30,653
You swore he wasn't coming back.

808
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:32,545
This is a good thing, Michael.

809
00:42:33,126 --> 00:42:35,242
It's going to be back the way it was.

810
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:36,771
The way it was?

811
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:38,881
We family again.

812
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,875
You lied to me.

813
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:49,966
People change, Michael.

814
00:42:53,389 --> 00:42:56,119
He say you can give him back
the independence card, too.

815
00:42:56,259 --> 00:42:58,384
He gonna take care
of all that for us.

816
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:11,252
Thanks for coming up from Washington.

817
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,259
The party is happy
for the opportunity.

818
00:43:13,326 --> 00:43:15,292
You got some heat
behind you at this point.

819
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,749
But down to business.

820
00:43:16,906 --> 00:43:17,986
The way we see it,

821
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:20,226
We got to cobble together
a citywide turnaround--

822
00:43:20,394 --> 00:43:22,456
call it the Baltimore miracle
or some shit.

823
00:43:22,738 --> 00:43:25,659
Which starts with a...
10% drop in crime.

824
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:27,260
Since that was your campaign cry,

825
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:28,493
you want the double digits.

826
00:43:28,636 --> 00:43:29,704
No doubt.

827
00:43:29,724 --> 00:43:31,982
Denny's got to do a bricks
and mortar project downtown,

828
00:43:32,016 --> 00:43:33,057
put his name on something.

829
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:34,459
Well, we flushed with stadiums,

830
00:43:34,526 --> 00:43:36,100
got hotels out of the ass.

831
00:43:36,354 --> 00:43:38,226
You guys got a good convention center?

832
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:39,892
And a convention center expansion.

833
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:42,609
Gotta put something up.
Get the sign on it that says:

834
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:45,397
"Brought to you by Tommy Carcetti
and the citizens of Baltimore."

835
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,868
Well, think on it.

836
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:48,925
But you don't have too
much time to decide.

837
00:43:48,992 --> 00:43:51,826
- Anything else?
- Education always polls good.

838
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:54,313
Oh, no, we got to
stay away from schools.

839
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:55,864
Our last 4 administrations

840
00:43:55,923 --> 00:43:58,693
left us with an inner city system
with inner city problems.

841
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,612
We get involved,
start talking shit,

842
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,017
it becomes our mess.

843
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,830
Gotta respect the depths.

844
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,153
One,
you get the drop in crime.

845
00:44:08,327 --> 00:44:09,926
Two,
you build something downtown.

846
00:44:09,992 --> 00:44:11,956
And 3,
you stay away from schools.

847
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:14,427
And, 4, you keep
your boyish good looks.

848
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:17,745
You do all that, you might be
running for governor in 2008.

849
00:44:17,861 --> 00:44:19,727
Maybe take back
that state house for us.

850
00:44:21,293 --> 00:44:23,901
- Can you get him a square corner?
- Easy.

851
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,998
I don't like things
with square corners.

852
00:44:26,057 --> 00:44:27,861
- They look like they have a--
- They don't.

853
00:44:27,926 --> 00:44:29,388
They don't fit certain things.

854
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:54,702
You OK?

855
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:57,510
Yeah.

856
00:44:58,664 --> 00:44:59,901
You sure?

857
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:03,315
- Is it something at home?
- No.

858
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:07,311
- Come on.
- I said no.

859
00:45:11,484 --> 00:45:14,096
If there's ever anything
you want to talk about...

860
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:18,017
there's me, but,
if you'd rather, I can write you a...

861
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:20,713
a pass to see the social worker.

862
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,660
Just say when.

863
00:45:29,186 --> 00:45:31,897
Michael, do you want to
see the social worker?

864
00:45:50,743 --> 00:45:52,676
I have to say,
I've never seen kids

865
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:54,625
like them
this animated in a classroom.

866
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,922
Focused--
the corner culture kids, at least.

867
00:45:57,061 --> 00:45:59,294
The ones with deeper problems,
they opted out of that.

868
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:00,561
Deeper problems?

869
00:46:00,628 --> 00:46:02,603
We're not just up against
corner logic in there.

870
00:46:02,642 --> 00:46:04,762
I am seeing
oppositional defiant disorders,

871
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,194
clinical depression,
post traumatic stress,

872
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:08,508
and with the girl Shaundra,

873
00:46:08,586 --> 00:46:10,094
borderline psychoses maybe.

874
00:46:10,161 --> 00:46:11,575
And with those type of problems,

875
00:46:11,614 --> 00:46:14,228
we are gonna have
a social worker here fulltime.

876
00:46:14,294 --> 00:46:16,795
But the corner kids, yeah,
they really came alive.

877
00:46:16,862 --> 00:46:18,359
When they talk
about what they know,

878
00:46:18,399 --> 00:46:20,235
they talk from here,
and they stay on point.

879
00:46:20,274 --> 00:46:22,258
Shit, they have been even
taking turns in there.

880
00:46:22,277 --> 00:46:26,007
Question is can we get them in that kind
of mindset on stuff they don't know?

881
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:28,027
Can we have them earn
on faith alone?

882
00:46:28,399 --> 00:46:31,042
In all honesty,
this is uncharted territory.

883
00:46:34,029 --> 00:46:35,384
Where do you go from here?

884
00:46:36,595 --> 00:46:38,161
How about we just let this ride?

885
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,395
See where it takes us.

886
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:42,941
All right, see,
here's the thing--

887
00:46:43,019 --> 00:46:44,795
once you got it, it's all you.

888
00:46:44,862 --> 00:46:47,061
Anything happen,
I gonna have to fuck you up.

889
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:48,495
Yeah, but that's nothing.

890
00:46:48,561 --> 00:46:50,661
'Cause the guy trusting
me on this-- Marlo--

891
00:46:50,831 --> 00:46:53,266
he'll kill you
and your whole family.

892
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,817
So, don't go shaking the vials,

893
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:56,776
'cause Marlo weighs
that shit every time.

894
00:46:56,835 --> 00:46:58,093
I ain't shaking shit.

895
00:46:58,211 --> 00:46:59,364
See that you don't,

896
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,517
'cause if you do fuck with it,
I'm gonna know.

897
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:17,561
All right, that's good.

898
00:47:30,628 --> 00:47:32,190
All right, it's good.

899
00:47:32,898 --> 00:47:34,729
All right, see,
you under 13 and shit.

900
00:47:34,796 --> 00:47:37,306
So, you safe from everybody--
but me and Marlo.

901
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:38,696
So, I'm lieutenant now?

902
00:47:38,763 --> 00:47:40,683
Yeah.
You're my lieutenant.

903
00:47:40,834 --> 00:47:43,112
And all's I get an extra $10?

904
00:47:43,764 --> 00:47:45,696
Yeah, you do this good,
and we'll talk.

905
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:53,028
See this guy here?

906
00:47:53,272 --> 00:47:54,962
That's the grand jury prosecutor.

907
00:47:55,028 --> 00:47:57,316
Now, you lie to us,
it's just good clean fun.

908
00:47:57,355 --> 00:47:59,440
But you tell tales to that
3-piece motherfucker--

909
00:47:59,479 --> 00:48:00,692
Oh, shit!

910
00:48:00,967 --> 00:48:02,303
I ain't telling lies.

911
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:04,162
Hey, Gary,

912
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,763
let me ask you this hypothetically.

913
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:08,763
how much time does a witness get
for lying to your grand jury?

914
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:11,032
You're kidding.
As much as I can get him.

915
00:48:11,091 --> 00:48:12,905
- What's the Max?
- 10 years.

916
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:15,596
You got people
going away for 10 years?

917
00:48:15,662 --> 00:48:17,480
Oh, hell yeah.
All the time.

918
00:48:17,852 --> 00:48:19,010
10 years.

919
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:20,757
I thought he was gonna say
like two or 3.

920
00:48:20,835 --> 00:48:22,962
Hey, look, that motherfucker
went upside my head.

921
00:48:23,021 --> 00:48:24,243
I couldn't even see straight.

922
00:48:24,283 --> 00:48:25,940
Which motherfucker
are we talking about?

923
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:28,022
Then they got me on that medication,

924
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:29,829
made me groggy as shit.

925
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,895
Then this man starts working at me,
was ahead--

926
00:48:32,962 --> 00:48:34,026
Fuck I did!

927
00:48:34,085 --> 00:48:35,262
I mean-- shit.

928
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,783
I'm still groggy now.

929
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:38,806
I mean, I got to...

930
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,531
is there a washroom around?

931
00:48:49,175 --> 00:48:50,923
Lying motherfucker.

932
00:48:52,238 --> 00:48:53,378
For real.

933
00:49:00,339 --> 00:49:01,928
<i>Pull over, asshole.</i>

934
00:49:03,863 --> 00:49:05,062
Shit.

935
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:14,091
Step out of the car, please.

936
00:49:15,463 --> 00:49:16,647
Step out of the car.

937
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:18,744
Put your hands on the car.

938
00:49:21,351 --> 00:49:22,608
Got anything on you?

939
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,294
Have a seat on the curb.

940
00:49:24,789 --> 00:49:26,085
Have a seat.

941
00:49:27,168 --> 00:49:29,124
Cross your feet.
Put your hands on your head.

942
00:49:38,985 --> 00:49:40,164
Fuck is this powder?

943
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,349
Lime from my mama's garden.

944
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:52,068
What are you building,
a clubhouse?

945
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,163
Oh, that shoot nails.
Be cool.

946
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,663
Oh, I know what it does.

947
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:03,182
I want my fucking camera.

948
00:50:10,866 --> 00:50:13,217
I heard what you said
at COMSTAT the other day.

949
00:50:13,296 --> 00:50:16,363
I also hear you are a--
Commander who knows police work.

950
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:17,929
That's what people are saying.

951
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:20,856
So, yesterday
I did a ride-along in eastern,

952
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,369
watched street pops,
undercover rips,

953
00:50:25,616 --> 00:50:26,951
so, what am I thinking?

954
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:29,182
My guess.

955
00:50:29,363 --> 00:50:31,590
You witnessed a waste of time,
money, energy,

956
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:33,043
and, in few cases, talent.

957
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,612
Rawls says it's Burrell
and his numbers game.

958
00:50:35,651 --> 00:50:37,969
He says if I unleash him,
put him in the driver's seat,

959
00:50:38,008 --> 00:50:41,543
then all of that bullshit goes south.
See a return of high-end police work,

960
00:50:41,922 --> 00:50:43,663
says it'll be the dawning
of a new day.

961
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:45,375
Rawls said that?

962
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,823
Yeah.

963
00:50:47,096 --> 00:50:48,748
Says he's just following orders,

964
00:50:48,896 --> 00:50:50,241
being a good soldier.

965
00:50:51,397 --> 00:50:52,644
What do you say?

966
00:50:54,383 --> 00:50:57,196
Mr. Mayor, if you want to talk to me
about what happens in the street

967
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,097
or what goes on
under me in the western,

968
00:50:59,164 --> 00:51:00,630
I'll talk your ear off.

969
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:02,880
But I'm a soldier, too.

970
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:05,788
I don't go up the chain
with my opinions.

971
00:51:05,997 --> 00:51:07,151
I can respect that.

972
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:09,013
I will say this though;

973
00:51:09,627 --> 00:51:11,866
we did have one unit
doing high-end stuff,

974
00:51:12,097 --> 00:51:15,295
Major crimes, working out
of an offsite down on Clinton street.

975
00:51:15,398 --> 00:51:16,953
"Did" is past tense.

976
00:51:17,731 --> 00:51:18,988
What wrecked it?

977
00:51:20,943 --> 00:51:22,396
Good question, Mr. Mayor.

978
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:25,532
With Ray fosters' passing,

979
00:51:25,977 --> 00:51:28,165
I'm going to need a new
C.I.D. Commander right away.

980
00:51:28,204 --> 00:51:31,347
would you object to being
made Colonel working under Rawls?

981
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:36,558
Under Rawls?

982
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,481
He is deputy ops, is he not?

983
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:44,968
Is the mayor going to make the changes
or just leave it to the good soldier?

984
00:51:46,433 --> 00:51:47,945
What I'm really asking is

985
00:51:48,459 --> 00:51:49,755
how for real are you?

986
00:51:50,831 --> 00:51:54,233
Well, I guess we're going
to find that out together, aren't we?

987
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:56,699
Colonel Daniels.

988
00:52:02,384 --> 00:52:03,798
What the fuck do we do?

989
00:52:05,658 --> 00:52:06,856
I don't know.

990
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:08,849
These guys don't scare.

991
00:52:11,224 --> 00:52:13,404
If we all kick in,
you, me, Sydnor,

992
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,132
maybe we could afford a used camera.

993
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:17,526
I thought of that.

994
00:52:17,937 --> 00:52:20,064
It ain't gonna match
the serial numbers

995
00:52:20,131 --> 00:52:21,805
from the one from A.S.D.

996
00:52:25,786 --> 00:52:27,364
You gotta get wood on Marlo.

997
00:52:27,783 --> 00:52:29,040
It's the only way.

998
00:52:31,133 --> 00:52:33,647
This Randy kid,
he can give us a murder, right?

999
00:52:34,564 --> 00:52:36,641
Shit, he can't even give us a body.

1000
00:52:36,997 --> 00:52:40,182
But he says some little Kevin kid
was the one supposed to tell Lex

1001
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,675
to go up in that alley.

1002
00:52:43,154 --> 00:52:45,668
Plus, what did fuck-nut
say little Kev said?

1003
00:52:47,025 --> 00:52:48,332
Lex went up the alley,

1004
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:49,854
but he ain't coming back.

1005
00:52:50,873 --> 00:52:52,523
Maybe he saw the whole thing.

1006
00:52:52,832 --> 00:52:54,808
Maybe he's our eyeball witness.

1007
00:52:55,298 --> 00:52:57,074
- Little Kevin?
- Little Kevin.

1008
00:53:06,868 --> 00:53:08,262
Carry the 4.

1009
00:53:08,632 --> 00:53:10,645
80, 100, 10, 20.

1010
00:53:10,898 --> 00:53:12,066
420.

1011
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:14,009
Where's the rest?

1012
00:53:16,268 --> 00:53:17,643
I'm on a hard strip.

1013
00:53:18,155 --> 00:53:19,373
Stuck me with Lafayette.

1014
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:21,165
What the fuck are you doing there?

1015
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:22,365
I got to build it up.

1016
00:53:23,372 --> 00:53:25,120
You ain't got to build up shit.

1017
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,182
Your father built them corners,
and they owe you--

1018
00:53:28,436 --> 00:53:29,732
'cause they owe him.

1019
00:53:30,232 --> 00:53:33,440
Bodie got a real short memory
when it comes to giving props.

1020
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:34,965
Ma.

1021
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:42,031
I going to straighten
this shit out right now.

1022
00:53:42,098 --> 00:53:43,593
Ma, let me build.

1023
00:53:49,508 --> 00:53:50,608
Sir.

1024
00:53:51,692 --> 00:53:52,799
Bill...

1025
00:53:55,888 --> 00:53:57,617
we need to regroup.

1026
00:53:58,455 --> 00:54:00,675
I've come up with something fresh

1027
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:02,332
for the new administration.

1028
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:08,373
I don't mind telling you,

1029
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:12,279
I'm uncomfortable the way
Carcetti is running around in our shop.

1030
00:54:12,465 --> 00:54:13,761
He's talked to me--

1031
00:54:14,636 --> 00:54:15,932
several times.

1032
00:54:22,465 --> 00:54:24,049
You're making your move, huh?

1033
00:54:33,328 --> 00:54:36,058
We were a good team,
you and me.

1034
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:38,640
We were.

1035
00:55:07,693 --> 00:55:09,028
Ms. Ella, where Bug at?

1036
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,857
- He went home, Michael.
- Nah, he waits for me.

1037
00:55:12,533 --> 00:55:15,428
The man who came to pick him up
said he was his father.

1038
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,240
And Bug said so, too.

1039
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:19,400
Fuck!

1040
00:55:42,685 --> 00:55:44,040
The fuck did you do?

1041
00:55:46,266 --> 00:55:47,833
And why do you let him do it?

1042
00:55:47,899 --> 00:55:49,333
- Hey, listen to me--
- No.

1043
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:51,767
That's how you got him
with his head up his ass.

1044
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:54,081
Unsolving his own fucking murders.

1045
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:57,721
Your job is to turn red to black,
not the other way.

1046
00:55:58,604 --> 00:56:01,039
And you,
stand the fuck up for yourself.

1047
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:14,312
You don't get to do the whole thing
on your fingers, little man.

1048
00:56:14,449 --> 00:56:15,973
Look, first count,

1049
00:56:16,442 --> 00:56:17,581
6 and 6 is...

1050
00:56:18,479 --> 00:56:19,579
12.

1051
00:56:19,635 --> 00:56:21,520
Put down the two,
you bring over the one.

1052
00:56:22,544 --> 00:56:23,644
Bug.

1053
00:56:23,732 --> 00:56:24,784
Hey, big man.

1054
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:25,924
Get over to me now.

1055
00:56:25,963 --> 00:56:27,574
- We were just going to--
- Now.

1056
00:56:59,055 --> 00:57:00,134
Yo, hold on.

1057
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,801
Yo, you owe me height hundred
on all that, bitch.

1058
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:36,397
