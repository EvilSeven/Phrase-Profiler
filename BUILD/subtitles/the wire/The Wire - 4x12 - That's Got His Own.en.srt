1
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:44,934
Oh, man!

2
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:32,479
What's next?

3
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:33,557
One to the head.

4
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:35,102
Keep it quick.

5
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:37,577
Not yet, motherfucker.

6
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:41,322
You shoot live rounds like paint.

7
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,700
Boy, you be the shit, you hear?

8
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,754
Yo, but these really do
look like Glocks.

9
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,778
Yeah, they make them
look that way.

10
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:50,489
Yo, why you shoot low?

11
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:52,794
All right.

12
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:54,783
If you're close,
aim for the head.

13
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:57,118
If not, think vest.

14
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,529
That's the way you said it.

15
00:02:58,694 --> 00:02:59,694
A'ight.

16
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:00,920
Boy's learnin'.

17
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:05,155
4x12 That's Got His Own

18
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,494
You going inside this one, too?

19
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:11,828
I'm gonna do the whole block.

20
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:15,449
It's bad enough you popped the top off
of one house and give us a body.

21
00:05:15,854 --> 00:05:17,698
What the fuck do you think
you're doing now?

22
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:18,794
An experiment.

23
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:20,129
An experiment?

24
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:22,390
Fuck me.

25
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:25,007
I'm dealing with Madam Curie here.

26
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,027
This nail here
comes from a nail gun,

27
00:05:28,623 --> 00:05:31,211
And it comes from the house
with a dead man inside.

28
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:35,219
Every other house has screws
that H.C.D. uses.

29
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:38,361
We find these in the plywood
anywhere in this city,

30
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,248
and there's a body inside.

31
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,805
Gosh, that's good work.

32
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,557
No, I'm very impressed.

33
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:50,552
Do you see a tool belt on me?

34
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:52,948
Do I look like
one of those fuckin' jerkoffs

35
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,699
in aisle 5 of the home fuckin' depot?

36
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:56,888
There's 3 weeks left in the year,

37
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,691
And our unit clearance rate
is under 50%.

38
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,809
We do not go looking for bodies,

39
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:06,276
Especially moldering
fucking John does.

40
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:08,760
We do not put red up
on the board voluntarily.

41
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:11,256
Jay, the bodies are in the houses.

42
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:13,166
Marlo Stanfield's bodies.

43
00:06:13,264 --> 00:06:14,695
Then they belong to him.

44
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:17,373
Now, I realize
you're no longer in my squad,

45
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:18,864
Mr. Major crimes,

46
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:21,359
But you're still part of C.I.D., right?

47
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,470
And look--
I'm still a Sergeant, right?

48
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,771
And I'm giving you
an order on this, Lester.

49
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:28,685
Until I feel
chain-of-command down on this

50
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:31,990
and until you hear otherwise,
you will not--

51
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:35,373
I repeat not--
pull down any more

52
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,941
Fucking wood!

53
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:50,206
Let it go, man.

54
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:52,128
I mean, you know,
I expect a shortfall

55
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,595
when I look at the school budget.
It's a natural.

56
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:57,771
But how in Christ's name
do you lose $54 million?

57
00:06:57,894 --> 00:06:59,161
One million at a time.

58
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:00,922
Exactly.
It didn't happen this morning.

59
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:02,512
This was on Royce's watch.

60
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,669
You didn't get a whiff
of this during council review?

61
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:09,761
You can't blame the council
or Royce for the school budget.

62
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:12,293
The fiscal responsibility is
with the school board itself.

63
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,184
But the council does have oversight--

64
00:07:14,262 --> 00:07:15,987
Don't even pretend
to put this shit on me.

65
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:18,242
Only the city share
shows up on our budget review.

66
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,911
We never see the state money.

67
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:22,368
You better tell your
pretty new chief of staff

68
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:24,133
that whatever happens
up on north avenue

69
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:25,393
is on the school system.

70
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,250
That's a simplistic view,
I think.

71
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,702
How would you complicate it?

72
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,054
As president of the school board,
I'll argue this is a bookkeeping issue.

73
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,128
We've simply been rolling
the system's debt over since '99.

74
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:38,498
You rolled it and rolled it
until it ran out of cash.

75
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,275
That's not bookkeeping,
that's stupidity.

76
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:42,608
So what are we talking
about here, waste?

77
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,641
Fraud? Embezzlement?

78
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:47,393
I would say that although
the system has

79
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,187
some poor accounting practices,

80
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:52,413
in the end we're going to find
that most of the money

81
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,260
was properly spent on programming.

82
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,588
OK, OK.
We get it.

83
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,961
No one's responsible,
not the school board,

84
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:02,298
not anybody on north avenue,
not Clarence Royce,

85
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:04,161
not the city council,
no one at this table.

86
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:06,617
Fine.
So what's our next move?

87
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,923
Bump the property tax rate?

88
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:12,707
Scale back our budget.

89
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:16,194
No pay hikes, hiring freezes,
reduced services,

90
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,134
Tell everyone-- Schools,
police, fire, public works--

91
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,164
they have to hold the line
for a year or 2.

92
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,610
How?

93
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:25,643
I just ran
a clean up the streets campaign.

94
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,179
I just got done promising the world
to every cop in the city.

95
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:31,358
Annapolis.

96
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,875
You go beg his republican ass.

97
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,535
The cheese stands alone.

98
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:52,417
This the drop?

99
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:56,592
I hope not,
'cause they ain't called yet.

100
00:08:57,953 --> 00:09:00,463
Make me feel bad toward
old Prop Joe.

101
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,895
Yeah, go around
where we can see y'all.

102
00:09:07,532 --> 00:09:08,865
Vamanos, 'Naldo.

103
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:27,764
Nice hook up.
Private.

104
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:35,288
Damn, y'all some semper fi
motherfuckers, ain't ya?

105
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:37,823
Where cheese go to enlist?

106
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:50,660
That's 25 back to Joe
from what we was short before,

107
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:53,188
and another 150
to up our order to 6.

108
00:09:53,747 --> 00:09:55,041
We had you down for 4.

109
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:57,727
I don't know if we got
extras coming off the boat.

110
00:09:57,794 --> 00:09:59,295
Short someone else, then.

111
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:01,480
I'll see what Joe says.

112
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,975
Yeah.

113
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,350
When we set with the reup,
we'll hit you on that.

114
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:14,761
The shit will be
where you told us half hour later.

115
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:17,053
- Yo, we ain't usin' these no more.
- Us neither.

116
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:20,288
All we do is ring you
from a 958 exchange eastside,

117
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:21,602
don't need to answer.

118
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,447
Just toss it,
go to the meet.

119
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:26,373
See you when I see you.

120
00:10:29,323 --> 00:10:31,636
Money on the table,
and Heron to follow.

121
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,382
Stay here on Marlo?

122
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:35,522
Naw, we gonna stay with Cheese.

123
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:55,100
Detective,
would you get the door for me?

124
00:11:12,926 --> 00:11:15,594
Sometimes life
just gives you a moment, huh?

125
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,038
He was gonna do me,
and instead he gets done?

126
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:19,594
I'm dipped in shit here.

127
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,878
I'm the luckiest motherfucker you know.

128
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:23,094
Gentlemen.

129
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,231
The target is still Mr. Stanfield,

130
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:26,926
and from the look of things,

131
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,960
we're no closer to him than
when I left here 2 months ago.

132
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:32,110
Now, they might not
let me go after murders,

133
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:35,197
but they cannot stop me
from chasin' the drugs.

134
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,073
Leandor, I want you
surveilling his people.

135
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:40,078
See if they're still up
on cellphones.

136
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,871
How are you with the paper trail?

137
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:46,274
I want you down
at the city assessment office

138
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:49,823
pulling paper on all the purchases
on the west side over $100,000.

139
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:54,261
Then get down to M.V.A. and check for
luxury cars in his name, all right?

140
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,957
Now, this boy has been in
the game for a while now.

141
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,994
He might try to launder money.

142
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:03,081
Herc, I want you on the paperwork,
rerequisitioning the wire tap equipment

143
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:05,462
that Marimow shipped
on down to I.S.D.

144
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:09,031
We're gonna need all of that
to get back up, OK?

145
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:10,969
If anyone needs me,

146
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:13,381
I'm down at missing persons, all right?

147
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,305
Let's go.

148
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:18,638
- Lester?
- Yes?

149
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,948
All this is cool.

150
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:24,424
But do you think we can do it so that
the direction comes from me?

151
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:27,188
I mean,
I am the Sergeant here.

152
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:41,031
Donut,
you think this look right?

153
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,031
Why you knock it down?

154
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:46,421
So the police
won't scope me so easy.

155
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,417
But now all they gotta do is be like,

156
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:51,698
"Yeah. Go over there and just grab
that little nigger with the braids."

157
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,699
Damn, boy,
you later than a motherfucker.

158
00:12:56,038 --> 00:12:57,940
Been sitting out here
watching money walk away.

159
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,744
You about to have the day off.

160
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:09,894
Package was stole, Nay.

161
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,927
What?
Out the back of your basement?

162
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:14,550
They kicked my motherfuckin' door in.
That's how they do.

163
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,099
Well, look,
how the police know

164
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:19,844
where you even be keepin' your stash at?

165
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:22,432
Some snitch-ass bitch,
that's how they know.

166
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:24,105
I'm gonna find his ass, too.

167
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:29,577
All right, man, I'm out.

168
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:37,572
I never did understand
why you stopped eating the pig.

169
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:41,442
I ain't been in
a Polock Johnny's since 1974,

170
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,391
and if you knew
what was good for you--

171
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,002
Look, I know what's good.

172
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:48,212
I remember when you did, too.
I never saw you going all Muslim on me.

173
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:50,870
Ain't that,
but I do believe that other faiths

174
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,360
have got the pig figured better
than us A.M.E.S.

175
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:55,591
See that?
If you checking out,

176
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,427
I might feel the need
to say a few words.

177
00:13:57,494 --> 00:13:59,509
Naw, I ain't got nothing
to do with that.

178
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,712
I love my pj's,
but they do repeat on me.

179
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:04,150
As memory serves,
you got to go with the original sauce,

180
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,797
not the kraut and chili like you do.

181
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:10,210
My pain ain't about no sauerkraut.

182
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:15,226
The puzzle palace
is ready to clip any program

183
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:17,320
that ain't tied to the statewide test.

184
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:19,727
And the thing is,
we just starting to make

185
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:21,317
a little headway
in what we're doing.

186
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:22,460
You take it upstairs?

187
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:25,557
Me and the professor went all the way
to go see the school superintendent.

188
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:27,616
- And?
- You read the papers?

189
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:30,393
They're a little busy ducking
that budget mess.

190
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,321
$50 million in the hole,
and they're scared

191
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:34,341
to take any more problems
to the new Mayor.

192
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,527
Is your thing a problem?

193
00:14:35,662 --> 00:14:36,877
Depends on how you look at it.

194
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,652
A cover your ass
type of person might say

195
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:41,260
we're tracking any students
that can't hack in regular classes,

196
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:44,377
giving them work that don't
show up on no statewide test.

197
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:46,594
City hall says it's OK,
they keep our program.

198
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,107
If not, we on the street.

199
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,776
Odell Watkins.

200
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,453
I was hoping
you'd say that name.

201
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,951
Yeah, he got Carcetti's ear.

202
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:01,910
If we sell him,
maybe we sell the hall.

203
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:17,228
Stalk that nigga, man,
that stole yo' shit.

204
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:18,883
- Yeah.
- Soon as he nod out,

205
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:21,128
bust 'em in the head
with a brick or some shit.

206
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:23,495
Nah, nah.
That ain't me.

207
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:25,414
You can always give 'em
a hotshot then.

208
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,166
Y'all recall junior Bunk?

209
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:29,464
Cutting his shit with,
uh, what you call it.

210
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:30,894
Stole it from the funeral home.

211
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:32,530
Oh, you thinking formaldehyde.

212
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:33,668
That's the shit.

213
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:35,690
Nigga's got a taste of that shit,

214
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:38,253
university started
a 'junior Bunk' ward.

215
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,488
My cousin laid his ignorant ass
up there 2, 3 times.

216
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:42,958
ain't no guarantee in that, though.

217
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:44,194
Use some rat poison, then.

218
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,621
No, man, that stuff
don't cook up right.

219
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,401
What you need to use
is that sodium cyanide.

220
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:52,713
That shit looks and cooks
just like the real thing.

221
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,571
- Where I find that?
- Try...

222
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:56,574
Minter's over there by the tracks,

223
00:15:56,644 --> 00:15:58,694
or one of those metal shops
where they do plating.

224
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:00,864
- How much I need?
- It ain't gonna take much.

225
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:03,936
A vial of that shit'd
kill every horse in this stable.

226
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:05,199
That's all there is to it?

227
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:06,694
It ain't no thing to kill a nigga

228
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:09,527
who's already about the business
of killing himself.

229
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,808
And the police,
they ain't gonna pay no never mind.

230
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:15,229
You the one's got
to live with it is all.

231
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:25,044
More young males
than I'd of thought.

232
00:16:27,924 --> 00:16:30,865
I don't suppose they all
went off in search of adventure.

233
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:33,894
You get a chance to do any
street work on these files?

234
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,304
Shit, no, Lester.

235
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,393
They cut missing persons
to 1 detective 5 years ago.

236
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,358
I barely keep up
with the paperwork.

237
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:43,981
Feel free.

238
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:48,319
Just make copies and return
the originals for the files.

239
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,700
For the files...
right.

240
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,382
Damn, son.

241
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:58,244
Kenard said the police took it?

242
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:00,387
He said they kicked his door in.

243
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,211
And they ain't lock no one up?

244
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:07,079
Yo, you see that door?

245
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:10,794
Were the hinges broke?

246
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:14,906
I mean, if he said
they put the boot to it,

247
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,477
them hinges gotta be hangin' free.

248
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:20,069
I sweated him, yo.

249
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:22,109
He wasn't trying to scheme.

250
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:26,697
That little motherfucker
took that shit for himself.

251
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,603
Bet it.

252
00:17:28,878 --> 00:17:31,211
And now you gotta step to him,

253
00:17:32,204 --> 00:17:34,381
put something real behind them words.

254
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:38,329
Where your Spanish boy at?

255
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:41,228
He stay on point with Cheese
while I round up soldiers.

256
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,881
You got soldiers right here.

257
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:46,023
Your 2255 must've pleased
some judge, huh?

258
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,981
Enough to get me home, didn't it?

259
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:54,236
I'm just sayin', Butch,
I know they soldiers,

260
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,761
but I'm thinkin' about being
a little more subtle on this one.

261
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,772
You feel me?
So they don't see me coming.

262
00:17:59,484 --> 00:18:01,794
It ain't like you
to work with strangers.

263
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:03,279
I'm celebrating diversity.

264
00:18:03,753 --> 00:18:05,753
I'm thinking now the time
to start doing that.

265
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:10,016
What up, shorty?

266
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:11,266
What's up, baby?

267
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:14,427
Damn, girl, you looking good.

268
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,451
- I'm maintaining.
- Shit, I know that's right.

269
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,156
- You doing all right?
- Yeah.

270
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:21,646
Long time, long time.

271
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,527
I got your word.

272
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:25,558
Some real money to be made
on this one, huh?

273
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:27,086
You remember how to do this?

274
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:30,162
I reckon it'll come back to me.

275
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:32,228
See that's what
I'm talking about, Butch.

276
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:33,393
Subtle.

277
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:42,074
Glasses first so they don't spot.

278
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:43,397
Yes, ma'am.

279
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:53,349
- Hello.
- Ho, Mr. Prezbo.

280
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:55,850
- Come in, please.
- Oh, that's OK.

281
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:58,730
I just wanted
to stop by on my way home

282
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:00,861
and drop off Randy's work
for next week.

283
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:04,218
Hopefully...
this thing will be over soon.

284
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:06,427
Maybe so,
but we're looking at

285
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:07,951
the possibility of moving him

286
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,827
to Booker T. Washington
next semester.

287
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:11,475
I hope that isn't necessary.

288
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:12,632
I hope so, too.

289
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:14,527
Anyway, thanks
for bringing this.

290
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,427
I'll try to keep him up to speed.

291
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,785
Hang in there, kiddo.

292
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:19,010
Thanks.

293
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:52,003
Long conference call.

294
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:55,446
About an hour so far,
by my watch.

295
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:58,835
Got me out here riding the wood.

296
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,128
Unfortunately
the Governor's phone call

297
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:03,160
has gone longer than anticipated.

298
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:04,687
Can I get you anything?
Coffee?

299
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:07,228
Look,
I have other appointments.

300
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,987
It shouldn't be much longer.

301
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:15,975
Check out
Fisher's column in metro.

302
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:19,276
He says,
the Governor thinks, quote,

303
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:23,292
"This latest fiscal emergency
calls into question

304
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,691
"the Baltimore school system's
ability to manage itself

305
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,893
as well as the local
oversight of the system,"

306
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,392
Unquote.

307
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:33,075
Motherfucker.

308
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,676
He's playing to the D.C. Suburbs.

309
00:20:36,794 --> 00:20:39,069
He sees you coming for him
2 years from now.

310
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:41,094
He ain't no fool.

311
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,296
There's all your electronic
requisitions right there.

312
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:52,469
What one's that, a cop?

313
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:54,988
Nah, security guard.

314
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:57,460
I don't think he's
one of Marlo's though.

315
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:00,260
Lieutenant.

316
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:03,762
Will someone explain to me
what the fuck the brass is doing?

317
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:05,927
First I get bounced
to telephone reporting,

318
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:07,594
then I get a call this morning...

319
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,460
How's that beach house coming, huh?

320
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:10,529
It's almost done,

321
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:12,980
- I just need a load of lumber--
- That's great, just great.

322
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:14,514
Welcome. Welcome back.

323
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:23,438
Who the fuck is that?

324
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,324
That, Sergeant Hauk...

325
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,839
is one of the most effective supervisors
in our police department.

326
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:37,470
Sorry.

327
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,927
It's just taking a little
longer than we expected.

328
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:41,871
It shouldn't be much longer, though.

329
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,993
I understand what you're saying.

330
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:47,895
Some of those kids
are ready for high school,

331
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:49,241
But not Duquan.

332
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,621
- I've--
- Adopted him?

333
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:54,994
I've noticed Duquan this semester.

334
00:21:55,186 --> 00:21:57,735
He's more nourished,
wears fresher clothes.

335
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,246
Sometimes he even smells like soap.

336
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:02,506
You and your wife...

337
00:22:02,945 --> 00:22:04,553
you don't have children, do you?

338
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:06,994
- Not yet, no.
- Well, have some.

339
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:09,027
For better or for worse,
they're yours for life.

340
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,122
The kids in this school aren't yours.

341
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:14,154
You do your piece with them,
and you let them go.

342
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,930
Because there'll be plenty more
coming up behind Duquan,

343
00:22:18,457 --> 00:22:20,457
and they're gonna
need your help, too.

344
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:26,376
You've got your third period
in 5 minutes, right?

345
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:34,460
Settle down.
Settle down.

346
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,293
We need to concentrate on these tests.

347
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,668
Ah, fuck this, man.

348
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:39,260
Talking 'bout,
"if Jane's father

349
00:22:39,327 --> 00:22:41,228
gives Jane 1 week's worth
of allowance."

350
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:45,254
Shit, I ain't got no allowance
where I stay at. Father, neither.

351
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:47,274
How many sides a sexagon got?

352
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,547
Why I care about that?

353
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:51,174
You need to take the test
so you can move on to the next level.

354
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:53,306
I ain't moving nowhere
but out this motherfucker.

355
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:56,759
All right, all right.
Let's settle down.

356
00:22:57,205 --> 00:22:59,264
Let's start with question number 1.

357
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:00,867
Settle down!

358
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:06,503
All right.
All right, listen up.

359
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:08,552
Here's the problem.

360
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:10,644
2 couples go into a restaurant.

361
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:12,827
- They get the check--
- Yo, when they say couples,

362
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:15,161
- do it mean they married?
- Why they got to be married?

363
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,199
Mr. Prezbo, why you even get married?

364
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:20,335
Well, to build a life together for one,

365
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,327
you know, family.

366
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:24,454
Also to have intimacy.

367
00:23:24,546 --> 00:23:26,652
- What do that mean?
- He mean, like, getting some.

368
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:30,182
No, no.
It's not just that.

369
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:34,803
Intimacy can be, um,
a quiet conversation.

370
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,500
Or it can fun, you know?

371
00:23:36,578 --> 00:23:38,993
Like when you tickle your partner.

372
00:23:39,075 --> 00:23:40,350
Yo, tickle my nuts.

373
00:23:45,421 --> 00:23:48,617
All right, all right,
no more of that.

374
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,130
Come on, let's get to the test material.

375
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:54,073
The statewide exam is next week,

376
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,574
and then we'll get back
to the regular lessons.

377
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:58,224
Can we talk about intimacy?

378
00:23:58,322 --> 00:24:02,327
If you like, and,
if I don't get too embarrassed.

379
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,066
All right, uh...
so the grand total on the check

380
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:11,078
is $67.40,
but if they want to leave a tip--

381
00:24:12,696 --> 00:24:15,304
Look at your sample test, please.

382
00:24:15,397 --> 00:24:18,042
I got to say, miss Duquette,
it felt like y'all schemed us.

383
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,101
This class is the same
as the ones down the hall.

384
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,610
Yeah, it's 'cause the test coming up.

385
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,159
OK, class, let's take a look
at the sample math test.

386
00:24:24,238 --> 00:24:27,561
- In sample "a", we start with...
- Kid's right. This is bullshit.

387
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:30,110
The test material doesn't
exactly speak to their world.

388
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,183
Yeah, don't speak too loud
to mine, either.

389
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:34,375
An estimate, Detective.

390
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,694
We start opening those houses,

391
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:39,409
we might turn over
a couple of dozen bodies,

392
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:41,468
but that's just me guessing.

393
00:24:41,508 --> 00:24:42,782
All of them homicides?

394
00:24:42,924 --> 00:24:45,081
The boy took over half the west side.

395
00:24:45,228 --> 00:24:46,930
We never saw the violence.

396
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:49,643
This right here is the reason why.

397
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,771
You're asking us to call out
half of public works

398
00:24:52,942 --> 00:24:55,360
and pull the plywood off
thousands of vacant houses

399
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,961
all so we can raise
the city's murder rate by 10%?

400
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:00,260
What else are we doing on Stanfield?

401
00:25:00,553 --> 00:25:04,260
I'm trying to get backup on his people's
cellphones as fast as I can.

402
00:25:04,327 --> 00:25:06,194
And I started to look for his money.

403
00:25:06,628 --> 00:25:09,628
But if I'm right about this,
they have to be worked.

404
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:11,363
Is there any evidence at all

405
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:13,535
that links all these
missing persons reports

406
00:25:13,593 --> 00:25:15,128
to the Stanfield organization?

407
00:25:15,415 --> 00:25:16,694
I'm just starting at that.

408
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:20,300
The one body that we pulled out of
the Fulton avenue house is Lex.

409
00:25:20,774 --> 00:25:22,637
His case is a direct tie.

410
00:25:23,097 --> 00:25:25,519
And there are 2 other names on
those missing persons reports

411
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:28,094
that show up in our wire taps
from earlier this year.

412
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:30,572
So, yes, there are links, counselor.

413
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,912
By any chance, did Landsman
run this up the chain to you guys?

414
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:36,187
No.

415
00:25:38,358 --> 00:25:39,515
Your call.

416
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:43,084
My office won't care
until they see case files.

417
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:53,202
I'll run it upstairs,

418
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:55,692
and we'll see what comes.

419
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:02,594
OK, I get it.

420
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,761
He's still tied up,

421
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:06,579
but it really should only be
a little while longer.

422
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:09,393
Can you tell the Governor
I have to go back to Baltimore.

423
00:26:09,585 --> 00:26:12,154
I have a little bit
of business today.

424
00:26:13,842 --> 00:26:16,235
I'm the mayor of a major American city,
for Christ's sakes.

425
00:26:16,294 --> 00:26:18,118
How much shit
do I have to eat from this guy?

426
00:26:18,157 --> 00:26:20,262
Wouldn't you play the politics
if you were him?

427
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,332
It's not like the state
had no role in this thing.

428
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:24,748
The state money for those
schools had no oversight either.

429
00:26:24,826 --> 00:26:26,798
But I'm not telling
the Washington fucking Post,

430
00:26:26,856 --> 00:26:28,385
talking about how
he might be forced

431
00:26:28,443 --> 00:26:31,424
to bail me out because--
What was the quote again?

432
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:35,809
Because "those are my children
in Baltimore, too."

433
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:39,011
He's gonna bleed me for that money.

434
00:26:39,893 --> 00:26:40,971
Mayor Carcetti?

435
00:26:41,128 --> 00:26:43,558
The governor's office
says he's ready to see you now.

436
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:47,422
$54 million's a big number.

437
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,373
We won't go until we get some,

438
00:26:52,432 --> 00:26:54,288
we won't go until we get some--

439
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:33,424
Did I do something wrong?

440
00:27:33,895 --> 00:27:35,483
I ain't acted up or nothing.

441
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:39,142
You're ready for this.

442
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:42,398
You can do the work.

443
00:27:43,217 --> 00:27:44,472
I know you can.

444
00:27:46,158 --> 00:27:49,111
And if you need
to come back here

445
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,142
and use the showers
or give me laundry,

446
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:56,235
use the computer,
you can do that any time.

447
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:00,161
Anyway, let me show you.

448
00:28:00,827 --> 00:28:02,670
This here the way to the hard drive.

449
00:28:06,355 --> 00:28:08,041
This isn't necessary, Duquan.

450
00:28:09,036 --> 00:28:10,722
Just in case I'm busy, Mr. P.

451
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,870
So you know how to work it.

452
00:28:44,185 --> 00:28:45,695
- Hey, boy.
- What's up?

453
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:49,132
Big day for you.
See here?

454
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,228
I got the inventory
divided between us.

455
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:54,142
You gonna go up one way
towards north avenue...

456
00:28:54,957 --> 00:28:56,660
and I'm gonna stay down
by the highway.

457
00:28:56,727 --> 00:28:58,850
You gonna let me handle
the money alone?

458
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:01,593
You ready, ain't you?

459
00:29:01,893 --> 00:29:03,094
Yeah, I'm good.

460
00:29:03,364 --> 00:29:06,148
All right.
Let's get on it.

461
00:29:07,094 --> 00:29:08,360
I see you back here tonight.

462
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:09,525
All right.

463
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,927
You see that foul motherfucker,
you let him have his money, OK?

464
00:29:14,994 --> 00:29:17,109
- I don't need you messing with him.
- All right.

465
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:20,775
Make sure that count's right!

466
00:29:23,893 --> 00:29:26,226
Yo, I need to talk to
the little motherfucker.

467
00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:28,246
Maybe you can do that with me,

468
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,940
see it don't get out of hand.

469
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:31,707
Hey! Yo, Mike!

470
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,164
Yo, what up, duke?

471
00:29:37,385 --> 00:29:40,090
I heard Randy's foster mom
gonna take him out of Tilghman, too.

472
00:29:40,308 --> 00:29:41,833
Send him somewhere else.

473
00:29:42,065 --> 00:29:43,438
That's messed up, man.

474
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:46,269
All right, holla, man.

475
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:51,451
How many?

476
00:29:52,414 --> 00:29:53,606
As a theory,

477
00:29:53,777 --> 00:29:55,474
Detective Freamon believes
there could be

478
00:29:55,513 --> 00:29:57,944
additional bodies in those vacants,
maybe a dozen or more.

479
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,226
He believes?

480
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:02,525
Lester Freamon is not
in the habit of selling woof tickets.

481
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:04,818
I, for one,
would not bet against him.

482
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:07,445
And what do you suggest I do
with this information?

483
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,744
My feeling is

484
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,309
that city hall should be
brought into the loop.

485
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:14,982
We pull the bodies now
before New Year's,

486
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:17,352
and the stats
go to Royce's last year in office.

487
00:30:17,786 --> 00:30:19,705
Matter of fact,
it gives Carcetti an advantage

488
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:21,333
with regards to
next year's crime rate.

489
00:30:21,391 --> 00:30:22,823
- You mean--
- Tell the major

490
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,990
that now is the time
to empty those houses,

491
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:28,715
not next year, when it's on his watch
and he has to eat the stats.

492
00:30:32,878 --> 00:30:35,100
Colonel, I see you've
thought this through,

493
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:36,534
politically, I mean.

494
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,430
I'm learning as I go.

495
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:40,288
I bet you fuckin' are.

496
00:30:42,102 --> 00:30:44,200
Colonel, keep this conversation close.

497
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,971
That's a direct order.

498
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,462
You seen those girls at Douglass, man?

499
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,292
Yo, you right, duke.

500
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,606
Ain't gonna be like
middle school no more.

501
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,584
You know, I'm just thinking, yo.

502
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:02,271
Dag, man, not again.

503
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:09,121
Where your people at now?

504
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,156
Need any of your stuff from the pile?

505
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:21,823
It ain't no thing.

506
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:27,276
Yo, man, listen.

507
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:29,200
Me and bug got our own spot now,

508
00:31:29,551 --> 00:31:32,002
so you could come
crib with us if you want.

509
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:43,811
What you mean
Kenard took the stash?

510
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:46,534
And he's still walking around?

511
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:49,567
I'm gonna talk to him, ma.
Make sure this never happen again.

512
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:51,285
Look at me, boy.

513
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:54,701
Kenard got to feel
some pain for what he did.

514
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:56,470
- He got to.
- I don't--

515
00:31:56,509 --> 00:31:58,146
You don't what, motherfucker?

516
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,467
This how you pay me back
for all the love I showed?

517
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:05,564
Shit, I been kept you in Nikes
since you were in diapers.

518
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,434
- I'm trying.
- You trying, huh?

519
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,614
That's what you gonna tell your father

520
00:32:09,673 --> 00:32:11,701
the next time you see him,
that you trying?

521
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,174
Or you gonna tell him
what you've done?

522
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,978
What he done got him locked up.

523
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:19,634
That's right.

524
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:23,346
Wee-Bey walked in Jessup a man,
and he gonna walk out one.

525
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:26,924
But you out here,
wearing his name, acting a bitch.

526
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:30,351
Oh, look at u,
crying now.

527
00:32:35,612 --> 00:32:37,063
Fuck you think you going?

528
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,609
Get your ass back here.
I ain't done talking to you.

529
00:32:46,912 --> 00:32:48,326
I mean, I'm police, right?

530
00:32:48,463 --> 00:32:51,015
Murder police,
and I got bodies.

531
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:53,334
I'm just supposed
to let them layin' lie?

532
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:56,034
"We don't throw red up
on that board voluntarily."

533
00:32:56,537 --> 00:33:00,145
That John Goodman off his diet
looking motherfucker was clear on that.

534
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:01,882
So go over Landsman's head.

535
00:33:03,098 --> 00:33:05,721
Jimmy, that's you.
Send an anonymous fax,

536
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:08,467
but you see,
Lester here don't fancy boats.

537
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:11,649
And me?
I get sick just filling the bathtub.

538
00:33:11,745 --> 00:33:12,904
It's just wrong.

539
00:33:13,218 --> 00:33:16,840
Yeah, just like when I seen J-Lo with
that little itty bitty Spanish dude.

540
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,098
Genius.

541
00:33:18,294 --> 00:33:20,257
He hid his mausoleum
right in the neighborhood.

542
00:33:20,316 --> 00:33:22,324
How little pedro gonna
fill that big thing up?

543
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:26,388
Oh, man, that girl got
a prime cut of ass, boy.

544
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,691
- And a good heart.
- A good inverted heart.

545
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:30,501
This nail's like their signature.

546
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,460
Find it in any door in the west side,

547
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,461
and right as rain
you're gonna find a body.

548
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,080
Yes, sir.

549
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:38,968
I'm proud to be chasing
Mr. Marlo Stanfield.

550
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:43,175
Man, you act like you on the trail
of Pol Pot or some shit.

551
00:33:44,918 --> 00:33:48,949
Motherfucker, I got $10 says
we can leave here right now,

552
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:53,041
go to any boarded up rowhouse
with a nail like that in the door,

553
00:33:53,243 --> 00:33:55,285
and we will find a body.

554
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,867
- Make it 20.
- There you go.

555
00:33:57,925 --> 00:33:59,651
But first let's have
another little taste.

556
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:01,190
- Jimmy, you in?
- I'm good.

557
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,846
Oh, come on, man.

558
00:34:02,964 --> 00:34:05,426
Take that skirt off and have a drink,
for Christ's sake.

559
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:06,603
Drink that.

560
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,137
Man,
don't play like that.

561
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:14,990
Icicles, get 'em before they melt!

562
00:34:32,597 --> 00:34:35,290
Hey, yo, Kenard.
Why you lie to me?

563
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:36,653
Fuck you talkin' about?

564
00:34:36,712 --> 00:34:38,435
You said the police
kicked your door in.

565
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:40,434
I seen the door.
They ain't kicked shit in.

566
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:42,303
- How you gonna lie?
- Go on, man.

567
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:43,833
Yo, where the package at, man?

568
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,892
Package up my ass, gump.

569
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:47,501
- Your mother.
- You about to.

570
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:50,597
Go on, walk.
Gump ass motherfucker.

571
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,768
Hey-- Nay!

572
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:57,641
Hey, yo, look at that
little dude getting his ass beat!

573
00:35:01,445 --> 00:35:03,387
Y'all was talking too goddamn much.

574
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:04,875
Go ahead, Nay.

575
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,856
Get your pack off this bitch
so we can go.

576
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:10,547
I ain't want it.

577
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:13,943
I ain't want it.

578
00:35:21,656 --> 00:35:23,500
I'll take that 20 now, Bunk.

579
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:26,197
I can't see shit in here.

580
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,465
Ah, man.

581
00:35:28,524 --> 00:35:29,551
I might

582
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:33,638
pull out my wallet, reach in,
and pull out a $25 by mistake.

583
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:36,353
I need me some
braille bills, something.

584
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:53,494
You ladies want to call
the crime lab?

585
00:35:54,024 --> 00:35:55,061
Nah, man.

586
00:35:55,504 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm like Stevie: too high.

587
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:58,952
You know I can't do no scene.

588
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:02,137
Well, there's not gonna be one,
on account of there is no body.

589
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:05,520
Not until the bosses say there is,
and when that happens,

590
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,461
you gonna miss all the fun, junior.

591
00:36:07,618 --> 00:36:09,478
You know Daniels is gonna
keep this alive.

592
00:36:09,557 --> 00:36:11,667
The white shirts will
fuck it up somehow.

593
00:36:11,888 --> 00:36:13,038
You know it, Lester.

594
00:36:13,312 --> 00:36:14,717
Maybe not this time.

595
00:36:14,952 --> 00:36:17,775
Daniels is C.I.D.
It's a new day downtown.

596
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:19,147
I got it.

597
00:36:20,652 --> 00:36:21,898
World is on its hole

598
00:36:21,995 --> 00:36:25,040
when Jimmy Mcnulty is the most
qualified to drive.

599
00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:27,667
Yeah, up is down,
black is white...

600
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:29,857
left is right.

601
00:36:48,983 --> 00:36:50,179
What we got here?

602
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:26,692
Quiet overnight.

603
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:27,829
Cool.

604
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:30,053
Relief will be here for you
after roll call.

605
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:46,932
It's Sergeant Carver.

606
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:53,760
How you doing, Dawg?

607
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:58,800
Quiet overnight.

608
00:37:59,436 --> 00:38:00,643
You go to school this morning?

609
00:38:00,682 --> 00:38:02,859
We're gonna wait a little
longer on that to be sure,

610
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:06,116
but I can't say I'm comfortable going
to work every day and leaving him here.

611
00:38:06,175 --> 00:38:08,100
Blow over in a week or so, you'll see.

612
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:10,208
Till then we still have
a car on the house,

613
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:12,659
and you have my cell number
if anything comes up.

614
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:15,294
We're gonna look out for you on this.

615
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,008
Have you had breakfast, Sergeant?

616
00:38:18,182 --> 00:38:21,048
- No, but I gotta--
- You have time for a plate, I'm sure.

617
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:23,542
Sure.

618
00:38:30,996 --> 00:38:33,741
I just dreamt something
gave me an idea today.

619
00:38:35,786 --> 00:38:37,355
Hey, Sherrod.

620
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,783
You remember when we turned

621
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:43,588
that knocked down light pole

622
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,833
at the scales?
Pulled $80?

623
00:38:47,804 --> 00:38:49,117
I been thinking we can

624
00:38:49,686 --> 00:38:52,519
get to topplin' a couple
of those bad boys ourselves,

625
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:56,523
get all Paul Bunyan and shit, you know?

626
00:38:58,284 --> 00:39:01,127
I mean,
we'll be all discreet and all.

627
00:39:01,911 --> 00:39:04,147
Not take the hacksaw
to no more than a couple

628
00:39:04,226 --> 00:39:07,832
on some quiet streets,
leave more than enough

629
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:10,147
for some people to
have light and all.

630
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,027
Thing is,
I got this other thing

631
00:39:15,106 --> 00:39:17,086
I still need to take care of today.

632
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:22,348
Come on, Sherrod.
Wake up.

633
00:39:24,564 --> 00:39:25,634
It's late.

634
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,961
No, no, no!
What you do? What you do?

635
00:39:41,437 --> 00:39:42,593
What you do?

636
00:39:44,537 --> 00:39:45,753
Come on, Sherrod.

637
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:51,055
Come on, man.
Come on. Come on.

638
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:54,632
You weren't supposed to do this, man!

639
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:05,401
Oh, man!

640
00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:06,906
No phones?

641
00:40:06,984 --> 00:40:07,991
Not a one.

642
00:40:08,246 --> 00:40:10,090
And the players that
were using them before,

643
00:40:10,188 --> 00:40:11,879
Chris, Monk, Ray-Ray,

644
00:40:11,996 --> 00:40:13,554
they were out there on those corners.

645
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,842
Now, I would have seen
if someone went to a burner.

646
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,274
Goddamn it.

647
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:20,981
If we just stayed up
on the wire 2 months ago,

648
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:22,843
we wouldn't be going through this.

649
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,132
Can I help you?

650
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:29,289
Which one of you is Sergeant Hauk?

651
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:30,889
I am.

652
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,830
I'm shea.
This is Thomas. I.I.D.

653
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:34,483
Let me ask if you remember

654
00:40:34,523 --> 00:40:36,680
pulling a surveillance camera
from I.S.D.,

655
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:42,369
Serial number AW466J9.
You remember that?

656
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:46,401
We also need to go over your paperwork
on a couple of informants,

657
00:40:46,804 --> 00:40:49,125
so if you don't mind
coming back downtown with us,

658
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:50,711
you and...

659
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:55,200
Detective Sydnor and...

660
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:57,747
the third guy, what's his name?
Dozerman.

661
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:02,234
You don't need Sydnor or Doze, either.

662
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:05,219
Paperwork's all mine--
on the camera,

663
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:07,868
on the informants,
me alone.

664
00:41:15,866 --> 00:41:16,891
Bodies?

665
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,167
- How many?
- Could be quite a few.

666
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:21,068
We won't know until
we take down those doors.

667
00:41:21,126 --> 00:41:23,504
And this is 1 drug
organization you think did this?

668
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:26,014
That's the theory,
but nothing's certain at this point.

669
00:41:26,132 --> 00:41:28,191
What is certain is that
if we're going to do this,

670
00:41:28,244 --> 00:41:31,668
you probably want us to do it now,
before the new year,

671
00:41:32,195 --> 00:41:35,301
while the bump in the murder rate
is still attributable to Mayor Royce.

672
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,848
Thoughtful, deputy,
very thoughtful.

673
00:41:38,306 --> 00:41:40,444
I don't want anymore stat games
from your department.

674
00:41:40,483 --> 00:41:42,326
You need to get your people
into those houses

675
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:44,934
because if there are bodies
in there, they need to come out.

676
00:41:46,878 --> 00:41:48,015
But do it now.

677
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,652
I don't want to be finding
anymore bodies come January.

678
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:54,065
Yes, sir, Mr. Mayor, sir.

679
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:38,864
Choice comes down to this.
We take the state money,

680
00:42:38,942 --> 00:42:40,640
and instead of being
fucked up and broke,

681
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:43,086
our schools go back to being
merely fucked up.

682
00:42:43,224 --> 00:42:44,361
No teacher layoffs,

683
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:46,634
no program cuts,
no school closures.

684
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:49,907
But the price the governor's asking is
more state control over the school board

685
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:52,461
and changes
in the teachers' union contracts

686
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,066
that would allow them to remove
tenured faculty for cause.

687
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,234
We don't take the money,
looks like we're shorting our own kids.

688
00:42:58,301 --> 00:42:59,774
If we take the money, we're giving up

689
00:42:59,813 --> 00:43:01,832
local control of education,
which is gonna lose us

690
00:43:01,872 --> 00:43:03,267
a lot of middle class black folks.

691
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:05,171
Not to mention the problem
you might have

692
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,626
2 years from now
running in the DC suburbs

693
00:43:07,863 --> 00:43:11,234
explaining how you needed their money
to bail out your schools.

694
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:13,426
He sees you coming, Tommy.

695
00:43:13,485 --> 00:43:15,074
That's not important right now.

696
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,567
Take the money.
We need it.

697
00:43:24,544 --> 00:43:26,200
Don't look at me.
If you take it,

698
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,514
you're selling out the teachers,
and that's my base.

699
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:30,828
If you don't take it,
you're selling out the kids.

700
00:43:30,945 --> 00:43:33,717
Either way, I'll probably rip you
and half the council will, too.

701
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,439
Just glad I'm not the Mayor.

702
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,167
You called?

703
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,565
Word down the chain.
Open 'em up.

704
00:43:48,594 --> 00:43:51,343
And it's my guess this case
is gonna need more manpower.

705
00:43:51,618 --> 00:43:52,668
Yeah, no doubt.

706
00:43:52,977 --> 00:43:55,734
In fact I might have lost Herc
to an I.I.D. File.

707
00:43:55,911 --> 00:43:58,701
Really?
I went light on him for that car stop.

708
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:01,192
I didn't even think
it would get to a trial board.

709
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,192
This feels like a bigger jacket.

710
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:06,301
Pick any 2 you want from C.I.D.
For now.

711
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:09,602
If you get back up on a wire,
we'll detail a few more.

712
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,867
Beautiful.

713
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:18,467
I don't know what you're talking about,
But she was hot.

714
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:21,433
I'm going back on Friday
right after work.

715
00:44:25,014 --> 00:44:26,034
Hold on.

716
00:44:26,804 --> 00:44:28,509
What the fuck are you staring at?

717
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,499
How are you liking homicide?

718
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:34,247
Loving it. Why?

719
00:44:38,663 --> 00:44:39,682
Anyway.

720
00:44:40,202 --> 00:44:41,575
It's on the way, boss.

721
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:58,486
It's Joe and his message,
but we already know what it is.

722
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,259
All right, girl.
Keep it close.

723
00:45:07,977 --> 00:45:10,683
All right, now,
call your amigos and tell 'em it's on.

724
00:45:24,575 --> 00:45:25,693
That's right.

725
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:29,026
Yep. That's it.
One, come on.

726
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:38,318
One, one.
That's right.

727
00:45:44,357 --> 00:45:45,730
What's going on, Mike?

728
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:50,656
Man, yo, I feel like
I could just pancake

729
00:45:50,734 --> 00:45:52,616
a young'un right now,
you know what I mean?

730
00:45:59,238 --> 00:46:00,967
What about you, duke?
Want some go?

731
00:46:01,264 --> 00:46:02,565
No, I'ma work this rope.

732
00:46:03,036 --> 00:46:05,100
Yeah, you working it.
Like a gump.

733
00:46:22,932 --> 00:46:24,049
They pull around back,

734
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:26,467
we're gonna come at 'em
from both ways, feel me?

735
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:37,066
Hey, yo, call your friends,
tell 'em where we at.

736
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:41,661
Yo, let me get that rope.

737
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,735
I said I'm workin' it.

738
00:46:42,754 --> 00:46:44,303
Man, I said you's a gump,

739
00:46:45,142 --> 00:46:47,404
fucking dog shit and
smelling ass nigger.

740
00:46:54,382 --> 00:46:55,598
Man, fuck this.

741
00:46:57,092 --> 00:47:00,034
Yeah! Go home! Get!

742
00:47:00,755 --> 00:47:02,412
Don't nobody
want you in here, no way!

743
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:03,883
You see what happened?

744
00:47:16,747 --> 00:47:17,845
That be it.

745
00:47:58,983 --> 00:48:00,179
Hey, daddy.

746
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:02,668
Kiss the butt of this lyricist.

747
00:48:03,135 --> 00:48:05,067
Blow on my Mike and make a wish.

748
00:48:05,134 --> 00:48:06,156
Get up!

749
00:48:06,902 --> 00:48:08,098
Everybody, get up.

750
00:48:09,742 --> 00:48:10,938
Get up!

751
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:14,032
Let me get a 10, daddy.
Let me get a 10. I need a 10.

752
00:48:14,051 --> 00:48:16,522
- Get the fuck out of here, now.
- I'll suck your dick for 15.

753
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,235
Trick-ass bitch, I said get.

754
00:48:19,023 --> 00:48:20,301
Don't you want to see my stuff?

755
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:22,231
Nah, ain't nobody
want to see that stink box.

756
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:24,528
- Get your ass gone.
- Come on, let me get a 10, player.

757
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,317
What the fuck is this, the inner harbor?

758
00:48:26,384 --> 00:48:28,050
Yo, what the fuck
y'all think you doing?

759
00:48:28,117 --> 00:48:29,734
- We painters.
- Si, we paint.

760
00:48:30,169 --> 00:48:31,326
Move the van out the way.

761
00:48:31,365 --> 00:48:32,875
You gonna like what I got, soldier.

762
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:40,202
See? We paint.
We paint.

763
00:48:47,082 --> 00:48:49,200
Which one of y'all
gonna open the truck for me?

764
00:48:56,607 --> 00:48:58,588
- Fucking amateurs.
- Yeah, yeah.

765
00:49:01,675 --> 00:49:02,921
Drink it slow, son.

766
00:49:07,288 --> 00:49:08,562
What am I gonna do?

767
00:49:09,424 --> 00:49:10,620
I'll run you home.

768
00:49:12,835 --> 00:49:14,462
I-- I can't go home.

769
00:49:17,482 --> 00:49:19,513
She expects me
to be my father, but...

770
00:49:22,076 --> 00:49:23,233
I ain't him.

771
00:49:24,518 --> 00:49:26,498
I mean, the way he is and shit...

772
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,371
it just ain't in me.

773
00:49:31,598 --> 00:49:33,256
What's between you and Michael?

774
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:34,789
Mike ain't Mike no more.

775
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:38,725
He went hard on his boy last night,

776
00:49:39,803 --> 00:49:40,903
fucked his shit up.

777
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:45,414
I can't go home.

778
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:48,650
I can't.

779
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,807
Give us a minute.

780
00:49:57,606 --> 00:49:59,096
Mad at myself, man.

781
00:50:00,384 --> 00:50:02,884
I shouldn't have shut
Michael out like I did.

782
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,986
Namond did push it.

783
00:50:06,456 --> 00:50:08,024
He ain't pushin' nothin' now.

784
00:50:10,399 --> 00:50:12,184
Reckon I'll go mend the fence.

785
00:50:17,442 --> 00:50:18,814
This ain't no motel.

786
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:26,017
Deacon, how'd you get by my people?

787
00:50:26,216 --> 00:50:27,608
You can't turn away church folk,

788
00:50:28,001 --> 00:50:29,256
ain't done in these parts.

789
00:50:29,585 --> 00:50:32,467
You only come by for a favor,
so what is it?

790
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:35,624
You know a fella named Bunny Colvin?

791
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:38,820
Yeah, that rogue police commander,

792
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:41,217
tried to legalize drugs.

793
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:43,294
- What's he done now?
- What did they say?

794
00:50:43,325 --> 00:50:44,517
He can tell you best.

795
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,017
You did not bring...

796
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:47,937
it's something positive, Odell.

797
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,271
Has to do with kids.

798
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:52,820
Bunny.

799
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:56,154
Delegate Watkins.

800
00:50:56,312 --> 00:50:57,451
What's this all about?

801
00:50:57,676 --> 00:51:00,049
It's another bright idea.

802
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,484
You Michael Lee's mother?

803
00:51:07,807 --> 00:51:09,238
He got papers on him or something?

804
00:51:09,581 --> 00:51:12,274
I ain't no kind of police.
I'm just looking to get up with him.

805
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:13,384
You ain't alone.

806
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:15,893
He booked on out of here,
got his own spot,

807
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:18,651
- took his little brother with him.
- You know where he stay at?

808
00:51:18,717 --> 00:51:19,931
He ain't tell me nothing.

809
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,634
You find the boy, you let him know
I need some help around here.

810
00:51:22,699 --> 00:51:23,987
I popped him and bug out my ass,

811
00:51:24,045 --> 00:51:25,810
and now they forgot where
they came from.

812
00:51:29,957 --> 00:51:31,617
What my ma said when you called?

813
00:51:31,823 --> 00:51:33,049
She was mad, right?

814
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:34,553
Not really.

815
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:46,588
His mother?

816
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:50,295
Lovely lady.

817
00:51:51,595 --> 00:51:52,791
What she say?

818
00:51:54,227 --> 00:51:56,461
Put that bitch
in baby booking where he belongs,

819
00:51:56,501 --> 00:51:57,912
let him learn something.

820
00:51:58,997 --> 00:52:01,704
She hung up before I could
tell her we didn't have a charge.

821
00:52:08,485 --> 00:52:09,870
<i>Baltimore city 911.</i>

822
00:52:09,942 --> 00:52:11,974
They beatin' a cop
over here on Pennsie and Gold.

823
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,117
- <i>Police officer?</i>
- Yeah, they're beatin' on him bad.

824
00:52:14,184 --> 00:52:16,736
- <i>Pennsylvania and Gold?</i>
- Yo, they firing shots now.

825
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:26,983
<i>Sign 13, report of shots fired,</i>
<i>Pennsylvania and Gold.</i>

826
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:28,864
<i>Signal 13--</i>

827
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:56,575
They cleaned the motherfucker out, Joe.

828
00:52:57,751 --> 00:53:00,115
Put it in the van them
Mexican niggas rolled in.

829
00:53:00,257 --> 00:53:01,909
I ain't hearing about no resistance.

830
00:53:01,948 --> 00:53:03,350
Man, wasn't no time for that.

831
00:53:03,417 --> 00:53:05,804
Omar had one of them commando
squads with him, man.

832
00:53:05,902 --> 00:53:08,706
I mean, he had this one ho
pulling guns out her pussy, Unc.

833
00:53:08,824 --> 00:53:10,275
The shit was unseemly, man.

834
00:53:10,608 --> 00:53:12,314
I got to hand it to Mr. Little.

835
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,317
I ain't see this one coming.

836
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:15,997
They took the shipment, Joe.

837
00:53:16,529 --> 00:53:18,513
Not no package, man,
the motherfucking shipment,

838
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:19,919
man, what we gonna tell the co-op?

839
00:53:19,978 --> 00:53:21,625
Where you think my mind at right now?

840
00:53:21,748 --> 00:53:24,513
All I know, it's a lot of gangsters
out a lot of shit, man.

841
00:53:24,772 --> 00:53:27,245
I say we mob up
and go find this faggot, see?

842
00:53:27,324 --> 00:53:30,150
That's what's really hood right there.
That's how you deal with shit.

843
00:53:30,281 --> 00:53:34,063
A lotta gangsters in that room
need to take us at our word first.

844
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:38,722
Yeah,
first thing they gonna wonder about...

845
00:53:39,668 --> 00:53:40,942

00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:53,757
Let me get a word with you, Mike.

That kind of thing

00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:11,968
Step off, nigga.

Young man, if I was talking to you,
