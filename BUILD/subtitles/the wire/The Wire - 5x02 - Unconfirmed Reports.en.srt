1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,590
You know how that go, right?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,500
Gave myself all these little
rules about what I wouldn't do.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,540
Like, I told myself I'd do
a lot of shit to get high,

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,420
but I swore I
wouldn't never trick.

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,530
So, after I'm trickin'...

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,700
I thought, "This ain't so bad.
I'll do this for a while

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,450
"except I'll make some more
rules for myself, like...

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,400
"I'm gonna use condoms,
and I'm never gonna go

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,440
"with more than one guy
at the same time," and...

10
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:32,620
Well, let's just say there are
certain things I told myself

11
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:34,638
I wouldn't never do.

12
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:39,448
You know what my disease
did to my rules, right?

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,563
Yeah. Whatever it is you tell
yourself you won't do to get high,

14
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,522
you're pretty much making a
list of everything you will do

15
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:51,541
as soon as your inner
addict tells you to.

16
00:00:51,557 --> 00:00:55,521
I mean,
that bitch wants to kill me.

17
00:00:58,417 --> 00:00:59,623
She does.

18
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,410
Even on my way here today,
she was telling me not to come.

19
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:07,603
She was tellin' me that I was all right
on the street, that it was all good.

20
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,510
I'm about done.

21
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:20,420
I want to thank you all
for letting me share.

22
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:21,511
Amen.

23
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,540
Thanks for sharing, Dee-Dee.

24
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:30,642
Always lift us.

25
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:36,422
We got finished a little early.

26
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:38,510
Anybody else feel like sharing?

27
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:44,413
How about you, Bubs?
Haven't heard from you in a while.

28
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:47,450
Get up there!

29
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:49,420
Come on, Bubs.

30
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,592
All right, Bubbles.

31
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:01,562
Hi...

32
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:04,541
- You know who I am.
- Hey, Bubs.

33
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:07,523
- Bubs. Bubbles.
- What's up, Bubbles?

34
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:10,581
- I'm a grateful addict.
- Hi, Bubbles.

35
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:14,420
Been clean 15 months Thursday.

36
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:20,400
This is the longest I been off.

37
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:25,412
I...

38
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:29,563
Hey, yo! Let's go!

39
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,642
I used to get so high, you know.
I used to love to be high.

40
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:38,520
Y'all see me out there
on Monroe and Fayette

41
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:40,502
doin' the dope-fiend
lean, right?

42
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:42,512
Be like this here.

43
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:47,503
I come out of it,
get a little more upright.

44
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:50,520
Realize people treatin'
me like a lamppost,

45
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:52,560
hangin' fliers on me an' shit.

46
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:58,471
Come winter, little kids hangin'
Christmas balls on me like a damn tree.

47
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:03,473
Summertime, they'd walk me over to the
garden, where the 9-till-9 used to be.

48
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:05,562
Make me a scarecrow.

49
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:15,503
Yeah. I used to
love to get high.

50
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:24,412
Got to the point...

51
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:33,552
You know, I'm not in the right
place to talk about this right now.

52
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:35,520
Keep comin' back, Bubs.

53
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:43,471
Thanks, Bubs.
Thanks for sharing.

54
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,560
Is there anybody else with
a burning desire to share?

55
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:51,422
Marvin?

56
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:02,470
THE WIRE

57
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:36,420
"This ain't Aruba, bitch."
-Bunk

58
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:44,622
It's quiet up in here.

59
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:49,511
You got the Bank of
America accounts?

60
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:55,603
That pile there.

61
00:06:00,636 --> 00:06:06,552
So, he claims to be raising
money for some basketball program

62
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:07,633
or day-care centre.

63
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:11,400
And the money comes in,
and the money goes out.

64
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:14,483
But no hoops, no day care.

65
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:18,583
OK, so say we get Clay Davis,
and say he flips...

66
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:21,431
- Well, then he takes us up the ladder.
- To who?

67
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,430
If Clay is stealing from
his own nonprofits...

68
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:26,450
That's an easy case for us to make
with all the paperwork we got here.

69
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:29,420
That's a straight-up theft,
maybe a tax charge or two,

70
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:32,643
but there's money that all
this paperwork only hints at,

71
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:36,433
money that doesn't show up on
a campaign finance report.

72
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:39,592
My guess is that Clay
Davis knows about that too.

73
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,540
I don't know, man.
I like street work more.

74
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:45,533
You'd rather sit in a
surveillance van days on end

75
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:48,581
waiting to catch Tater
handing Pee Wee a vial?

76
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:51,520
This, Detective,
is what you're telling me?

77
00:06:51,535 --> 00:06:56,401
A case like this here,
where you show who gets paid

78
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,593
behind all the
tragedy and the fraud,

79
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:03,551
where you show how the
money routes itself,

80
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:07,562
how we're all, all of us vested,
all of us complicit?

81
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,432
Career case, huh?

82
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:15,531
Baby, I could die happy.

83
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:22,512
Still, man, I wonder what Marlo
is up to right fucking now.

84
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,493
Celebrating.

85
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:29,491
Yeah, but they still
taking pictures?

86
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:32,472
No. I ain't feel
nothing in a while.

87
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:35,490
We took care that thing over
the Eastside. They ain't on me.

88
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,531
Snoop, she been rolling
around all week.

89
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:40,433
Nothing, no cars,
no vans, no helicopters.

90
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:42,580
Monk, he checked after the re-up,
no problem.

91
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:45,523
- We wore 'em down.
- Well, what about cameras?

92
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:48,593
Nothing since the camera we took
out the wall back at the place.

93
00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:51,520
My overnight man, he been watchin',
he ain't seen nothing either.

94
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:54,481
'Sides, I think we good as long
as we movin' around like this.

95
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:56,641
Back to bidness, I say.

96
00:07:57,406 --> 00:08:00,491
She ain't had no work in a few months.
She somewhat eager.

97
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:01,643
Goddamn right.

98
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:04,621
Too much fuckin' talkin'
around here lately, man.

99
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:07,460
Niggers need to shut the fuck up.
For real.

100
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:08,600
A'ight, first thing.

101
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:10,613
We go hard at Webster
Franklin's crew.

102
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:14,203
Gave 'em the chance to get on our tit,
he passed.

103
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:16,581
Now we bang on his corners a
couple of times till he fold.

104
00:08:16,618 --> 00:08:18,492
Now you talkin'.

105
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:22,543
Yeah. Next, we step to June
Bug for talkin' that shit.

106
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:27,502
He was a dead man when he opened his
mouth. He just walkin' around
not knowing it.

107
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:30,433
An' I want that dicksucker.

108
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:33,540
Took my money and
the whole world know?

109
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,520
Nah. He got to fall.

110
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:38,520
Omar rolled out in
retirement and shit.

111
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:42,400
- I'm hearin' somewheres south.
- Bring his ass back out of retirement.

112
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,482
- A'ight.
- Yeah, a'ight.

113
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:47,293
We can step that shit up,

114
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:49,512
but he's goin' to be comin'
at us like we comin' at him.

115
00:08:49,548 --> 00:08:51,602
I mean, Joe and them,
they said let that be.

116
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:53,630
The crown ain't worth much

117
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:57,522
if the nigger wearin' it
always gettin' his shit took,

118
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,450
and Joe oughta know that.

119
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:02,403
Let him come. Yeah.

120
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:06,453
What up with that
thing down at Jessup?

121
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:08,460
You on the list.

122
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:11,583
Go on down there any time you want.
No problem.

123
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:13,623
That's the dude right there.

124
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:18,442
Ya hear?

125
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,581
Time for y'all to earn
your pay, niggers.

126
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:31,450
Hey, Walon.

127
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:34,622
I'm like, "What the fuck?
What the hell do I look like?"

128
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:36,630
Funny how you started out.

129
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:40,563
- What you mean?
- Dope-fiend lean and all.

130
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:45,630
Why didn't you keep going?

131
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:50,492
You know, you hear a lot of
funny shit in these rooms,

132
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:55,442
people makin' fun of their mistakes,
makin' people laugh,

133
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:00,430
but in between all the jokes,
there's a lot of truth to be spoke.

134
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:05,400
Like that girl today.
She damn near bled out, didn't she?

135
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:07,431
Yeah.

136
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:10,450
For a second there,
I thought you might actually stand up

137
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:12,540
and talk about Sherrod.

138
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:16,413
"A searching and fearless moral
inventory." That's the step.

139
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:19,613
Don't tell me about that.
I live with that every fuckin' day, man.

140
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:22,540
You got to let it
out to let it go.

141
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,423
I'm your sponsor, and I'm telling you,
you got to get out of your head,

142
00:10:25,435 --> 00:10:27,603
- outside yourself.
- I ain't never missed a meeting.

143
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:29,500
I'm not talking
about the meetings.

144
00:10:29,514 --> 00:10:31,598
I'm talking about where
you go after the meetings.

145
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:37,458
I'm talking about what you do,
what you think, what you feel.

146
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,543
I don't feel nothing.

147
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,543
That was never your problem.

148
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,443
Not even as a low-bottom dope fiend,
that was never the problem.

149
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:48,553
It would be a fuckin' shame
to make it the problem now.

150
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:54,493
So Carcetti threw
us a bone, huh?

151
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,500
Took the cap off
secondary employment.

152
00:10:56,516 --> 00:11:00,520
Yeah. Even I may have to go
out and find honest work.

153
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:03,420
There's no money to be made
in this policing shit.

154
00:11:03,435 --> 00:11:05,483
They made that clear enough.

155
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:07,403
What are you qualified to do?

156
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:10,562
Aside from that, I mean.

157
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,640
You know I got an in on
the eight-to-four gig over

158
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,442
at Friedman's Jewelry,
you know, off of Reisterstown.

159
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:18,501
Yeah, 20 an hour.

160
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:20,620
Stand around with some
shiny shit and get paid.

161
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:22,610
Work murders and starve.

162
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,510
Fuck kind of shit is that?

163
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,590
Anything from overnight
or this morning?

164
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:28,623
Yeah, midnight
shift caught one.

165
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:31,500
- Solved?
- Open.

166
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:35,471
Bar cutting from Curtis Bay.
Fahlteich's over at the morgue now.

167
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:37,422
Slow night.

168
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:39,431
Oh, I'm sure things
will be picking up

169
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:42,500
now we're no longer
sitting on Marlo Stanfield.

170
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:45,643
It wasn't my call to suspend
the investigation, Jimmy.

171
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:47,761
That decision came
from your shop.

172
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:51,531
Yeah, but nobody from the SA's
office objected, did they?

173
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,443
Just like nobody objected
when Chris and Snoop

174
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:56,510
got their gun charges
postponed a couple of times.

175
00:11:56,527 --> 00:12:00,512
A postponement or two is pro forma
on Calvert Street. You know that.

176
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:03,580
Pro forma, from the Latin,

177
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,403
meaning lawyers
jacking each other off.

178
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:07,541
Rules are the rules, Jimmy.

179
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:09,550
There are no fucking rules.

180
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,601
Fucking game's rigged.

181
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,501
Gentlemen.

182
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:25,482
Why the fuck chew on Ronnie's arm, huh?
She ain't the problem.

183
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:28,460
Tired of being jerked around.

184
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:32,441
I think I'm gonna get
me a secondary job

185
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:34,530
at that high-end cigar
shop on Baltimore Street.

186
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,550
As what? The Indian out front?

187
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:40,422
I'd like to scalp your
ass, motherfucker.

188
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:41,580
Got it.

189
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,422
Who's up?

190
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:50,512
There you go, givin' a fuck when
it ain't your turn to give a fuck.

191
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:54,412
He's a pissy little
bitch today.

192
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,563
I'm worried for the boy.

193
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:26,641
Some good news for a change,
the test scores for third-graders

194
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,612
going up a good 15 points.

195
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:30,623
That's what I get
for 54 million?

196
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:34,533
Hey, you can run on that.
15 points is a nice, solid number.

197
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:37,461
Whatever bump in the test scores I get,
I got to run on it.

198
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,553
I sure as hell can't
campaign on the crime rate.

199
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:42,471
Burrell already told us we don't
have a double-digit decline.

200
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:43,611
A small drop, most likely.

201
00:14:43,628 --> 00:14:46,601
Until we take back the statehouse,
this city will starve.

202
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:49,512
I get to Annapolis,
and whoever I leave behind as mayor -

203
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:51,581
Bond, Campbell, or who knows -

204
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:53,261
they're gonna have
a better time of it.

205
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:55,593
It's not gonna be Nerese if
she keeps goin' like she has.

206
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,531
Sun papers made her look bad.

207
00:14:57,547 --> 00:15:02,420
Yeah. She tells me this real estate flip
was a holdover from the
last administration.

208
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:05,480
True as far as it goes,
but she got herself paid as well.

209
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,542
She looked bad enough that
it'll cost you votes,

210
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:09,463
people who don't want
to make you governor

211
00:15:09,478 --> 00:15:12,572
if that means Nerese finishes your term
as mayor. She makes you vulnerable.

212
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:15,490
What, can I ask,
makes the governor vulnerable?

213
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:18,460
He looked like a petulant little
bitch with that diatribe on Olesker.

214
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:19,581
He looked paranoid too.

215
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:21,542
What about his
failure on slots?

216
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:25,480
With a Democratic assembly, everyone
expects a GOP governor will take
his lumps.

217
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:28,581
Besides, voters are split
on legalizing slots.

218
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:33,630
It has to hit him directly.

219
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:37,582
Well, I'll see what's on the mind
of the PG County boys tonight.

220
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:40,573
I got dinner with Steny, Miller
and Maloney down in Upper Marlboro,

221
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:43,532
- which reminds me...
- You're late to meet Jen.

222
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:53,570
Doesn't this seem a
little thin to you,

223
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,633
running for governor two
years into a four-year term?

224
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:59,423
Everything's thin.

225
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:02,550
The whole world shines
shit and calls it gold.

226
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:10,571
So Somerville, he keeps going back to
ask Tommy the elder follow-ups, right?

227
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,540
One question after another his
editor wants him to ask him.

228
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:18,530
Somerville, knocking on big Tommy's
door, blaming the city desk,

229
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:22,300
saying, "I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr Mayor, but my desk wants to know."

230
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:24,603
- Shit, I see it coming.
- So, three or four times, right?

231
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:28,542
"My desk is wondering...
I'm sorry to bother you, Mr Mayor,

232
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:30,433
"but my desk wants to know."

233
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,533
So finally, finally,
Tommy D'Alesandro,

234
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:35,541
he puts his ear down to his
desk like this, and he says...

235
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:38,632
"My desk tells your desk
to go fuck itself."

236
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:43,633
- That really happen?
- Too good a story to check out.

237
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:48,570
Hey. What's my favourite GA reporter
have today for his favourite editor?

238
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:50,601
Heartbreaker from Eastside.

239
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:55,633
Salt-of-the-earth single mother of four
dies from allergic reaction to
blue crabs.

240
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:59,461
Ate them all her life but goes face
down in a lump backfin platter,

241
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,160
pronounced an hour
later at Hopkins,

242
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:03,591
and the sister is starting a
scholarship fund for the kids.

243
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:05,642
Interviewed the whole family.
Photos, the works.

244
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:07,421
Attaboy.

245
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:10,561
Round it off with some medical
stuff on seafood toxicity, huh?

246
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:14,413
- Growing incidence, all that good shit.
- All right, cool.

247
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:21,493
You ever notice how mother of
four is always catching hell?

248
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:24,440
Murder, hit-and-run,
burned up in row-house fire,

249
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:25,563
swindled by bigamists.

250
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:26,641
Tough gig, mother of four.

251
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:30,450
Innocent bystander is worse.
He's always getting the short end.

252
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,581
Not a lot of them
around any more.

253
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:34,602
Not a lot of innocence either,
you ask me.

254
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:37,590
You know who there's less of?
Statuesque blondes.

255
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:41,483
You don't read about statuesque
blondes in the newspapers any more.

256
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,403
Buxom ones, neither.

257
00:17:43,415 --> 00:17:45,552
They're like a lost race.

258
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,560
What do you got next?

259
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:50,611
School project meeting.

260
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:53,431
Mr Whiting builds his Pulitzer.

261
00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:08,443
OK. Now I've seen everything.

262
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:24,531
Why not call a cab, at least?

263
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:27,501
If I thought these motherfuckers
would reimburse me, I would have.

264
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:29,511
So Homicide can't
shop cars neither.

265
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:31,492
We're down to two
working units.

266
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:35,503
One was at the morgue with Fahlteich,
the other was on a fresh call.

267
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:38,463
Jesus. What a joke.

268
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:44,410
67-year-old female, mother of four,
grandmother to many,

269
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:45,642
lived alone.

270
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:48,531
Not seen in two days,
so the neighbour called.

271
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,533
- No forced entry.
- You the first officer?

272
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:53,532
Had to kick in the back door.

273
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:56,472
- You call for crime lab?
- We're on the list.

274
00:18:56,486 --> 00:18:57,590
Today's list?

275
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:01,521
Fucking crime lab too, huh?
They've cut everything to the bone.

276
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:07,443
Been here maybe
a couple of days.

277
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:11,611
If it was warmer,
she'd have bloated.

278
00:19:11,627 --> 00:19:14,611
Yeah, it's probably natural.

279
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:19,423
I just didn't like the way she looked
laying there with the pillow and all.

280
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,613
Yeah, I bet she
died in her sleep.

281
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:24,573
You ever wake up with a
pillow over your face?

282
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:27,633
There's mornings with a hangover
I hold the pillow over my face,

283
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:30,451
just to keep the light
out and the pain down.

284
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:33,640
Me, I just throw up once
or twice and go to work.

285
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:37,401
The Western District way.

286
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:09,433
The word I'm thinking
about is Dickensian.

287
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:12,582
We want to depict the Dickensian
lives of city children

288
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:15,532
and then show
clearly and concisely

289
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,490
where the school system
has failed them.

290
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:20,570
Not to defend the school system, but a
lot of things have failed those kids.

291
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,473
They're marginalized long
before they walk into class.

292
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:25,451
You want to look at who
these kids really are,

293
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:27,483
the parenting,
or lack of it, in the city.

294
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:30,430
The drug culture,
the economics of these neighbourhoods.

295
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:32,522
Yet the schools are something
that we can address.

296
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:34,481
Sure, we can beat
up on city schools.

297
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:36,850
Lord knows they deserve to be
beat on every once in a while,

298
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:40,432
but then we're just as irrelevant
to these kids as the schools are.

299
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:42,422
I mean, it's like you're
up on a corner of a roof

300
00:20:42,437 --> 00:20:45,500
and you're showing some people how
a couple of shingles came loose,

301
00:20:45,515 --> 00:20:47,951
and meanwhile, a hurricane wrecked
the rest of the damn house.

302
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:51,471
You don't need a lot of context to
examine what goes on in one classroom.

303
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:55,502
Really? I think you need a lot of
context to seriously examine anything.

304
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:58,623
No. I think Scott is
on the right track.

305
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:02,442
We need to limit the scope,
not get bogged down in details.

306
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:04,611
To do what? To address the
problem or to win a prize?

307
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:06,451
I mean, what are we doing here?

308
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:08,573
Look, Gus, I know the problems.

309
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:11,491
My wife volunteers
in a city school,

310
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:14,432
but what I want to look
at is the tangible,

311
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:17,153
where the problem and solution
can be measured clearly.

312
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:19,612
There's more impediments to
learning than a lack of materials

313
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:23,592
- or a dysfunctional bureaucracy.
- But who's going to read that?

314
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:26,511
What is this series
about in a sentence?

315
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:27,633
What's the budget line?

316
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:32,431
Johnny can't write 'cause Johnny
doesn't have a fucking pencil.

317
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:35,620
Augustus, I'm not as
simple-minded as you might think.

318
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:39,552
Now what do you want, an educational
project or a litany of excuses?

319
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:44,641
I don't want some amorphous
series detailing society's ills.

320
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:48,403
If you leave everything in,
soon you've got nothing.

321
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,483
I think the schools are
ripe for exploration,

322
00:21:51,496 --> 00:21:55,401
and I think Scott might be
the man to lead the charge.

323
00:22:09,616 --> 00:22:12,480
You ain't doin' nothin'
but aggravatin' me now.

324
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,531
Get up in this house before I
beat the black off your ass.

325
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:19,422
Get up in here, fool. Come on.

326
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:21,523
Treena.

327
00:22:21,536 --> 00:22:24,440
Treena. Wait for me.
I'm-a come back out.

328
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,422
Stay right here. Don't move.

329
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:27,521
Come on, girl.

330
00:22:45,487 --> 00:22:48,403
Wooton, you dump in the numbers
from the port story yet?

331
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:49,531
Shit. I forgot. You want...

332
00:22:49,546 --> 00:22:53,442
- Give them to me. I'll put them in.
- Overall, cargo is down by 12 points,

333
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:56,571
but roll-on,
roll-off gained 6.4% last year.

334
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:59,630
A'ight. Drop 12, ro-ro's up 6.4.
Thanks, got it.

335
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,401
Boss man on your six.

336
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:04,461
- Whiting?
- Worse. Klebanow.

337
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:05,531
Augustus.

338
00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:09,520
Who's the lead for opening day tomorrow?
Not the game story but the
colour piece.

339
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:11,531
Luxenberg wanted to
go with McGuire.

340
00:23:11,545 --> 00:23:14,552
I think Scott would do an excellent
job with the colour piece.

341
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:17,492
I'd really like to find
some chaw-chewing old-timer

342
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:19,551
who'd die rather than
miss the O's opener,

343
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:21,603
someone who says "baseball",
you know?

344
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:23,633
You're the boss.

345
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:25,630
Scott, put your
special touch on it,

346
00:23:25,647 --> 00:23:29,421
like you did with your
Preakness piece last year.

347
00:23:29,435 --> 00:23:31,483
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

348
00:24:15,646 --> 00:24:17,481
Fuck.

349
00:24:19,606 --> 00:24:23,421
- What's wrong?
- It's all right, go back to sleep, baby.

350
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,480
- Metro desk.
- Hey, Spry, it's me.

351
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:30,531
Hey, is the night man
still on the copy desk?

352
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:32,520
Sure is.
You need to make a change?

353
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,533
Yeah, yeah,
I just want to check on the port story.

354
00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:37,591
I think I might have
transposed some numbers.

355
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:39,632
Andy, can I get port back?

356
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,522
Yeah, sure.

357
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:43,580
We got time on the final.
Go ahead.

358
00:24:43,598 --> 00:24:45,592
Yeah. Somewhere down
in the A-matter,

359
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:48,512
a graph about the cargo
trends with percentages.

360
00:24:48,527 --> 00:24:50,591
- Ro-ro, cargo...
- Read that back to me.

361
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:53,630
Cargo down 12%, ro-ro up 6.4.

362
00:24:53,645 --> 00:24:57,573
12-point decrease and a
6.4 bump on the ro-ro?

363
00:24:57,587 --> 00:24:59,482
Yep, that's it.

364
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:03,551
Shit. I woke up in a sweat 'cause I
thought I'd fucked that up. You sure?

365
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:08,543
Tonight, you had the usual deadline
nightmare to no actual purpose.

366
00:25:09,497 --> 00:25:11,503
I guess you're better at
this than you thought.

367
00:25:11,517 --> 00:25:13,463
Yeah, I guess.

368
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,482
- Thanks, Jay.
- Anytime. Good night.

369
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:20,531
The husband's thinking, "Gosh." I mean,
the police show up at his door

370
00:25:20,547 --> 00:25:23,440
and say,
"The lady you married from the Ukraine,

371
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:27,471
"A, she's dead, B,
she's got a 2005 gold Mercedes..."

372
00:25:39,447 --> 00:25:41,441
How long till my old lady?

373
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:45,562
It's gonna be a while.
Got my hands full.

374
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,470
I'm across the street
for breakfast.

375
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:49,581
- There's only one way to rule.
- Come on. Bullshit.

376
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:51,642
This is not a murder.
He overdosed.

377
00:25:52,307 --> 00:25:54,321
Look, we found his gear
on the bathroom floor,

378
00:25:54,337 --> 00:25:57,073
and his girlfriend, who called 911,
said the two of them were firing.

379
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:59,583
I don't have the tox results yet,
but even if they find heroin,

380
00:25:59,597 --> 00:26:01,382
it'd be a secondary cause.

381
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:03,601
I've got petechials,
I've got bruising around the neck.

382
00:26:03,635 --> 00:26:06,551
My preliminary is homicide
by mechanical asphyxia.

383
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:09,022
OK, fine. I'll fucking
bring the paramedic in here,

384
00:26:09,037 --> 00:26:11,611
and he'll fucking explain it to
you himself. Yeah, that's right.

385
00:26:11,645 --> 00:26:14,432
I'm going to go all the way out
to Dundalk, drag his ass in here

386
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,622
so you can hear it from him,
'cause I ain't taking this as a murder.

387
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:20,612
Hey, Jimmy.

388
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:22,623
Hey, Nancy. How's tricks?

389
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:25,530
- Heard you were working murders again.
- Yeah.

390
00:26:25,546 --> 00:26:28,262
- How's life in the County?
- Worse every year.

391
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:30,590
You guys can't keep all the
dirt on your side of the line.

392
00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:32,572
What's Kevin so hot about?

393
00:26:32,588 --> 00:26:35,630
Oh, new cutter's dug her heels in,
says it's a murder.

394
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:39,401
It's not, but I can see why
she'd think strangulation.

395
00:26:39,415 --> 00:26:42,520
Guy's got a fractured hyoid,
petechiae in both eyes,

396
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:44,453
but it's a freak thing.

397
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:47,511
If we weren't there to see it,
I wouldn't have believed it myself.

398
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:49,431
It's all postmortem.

399
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:51,540
He fires up a speedball,
then blacks out,

400
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:53,491
falls between
toilet and bathtub,

401
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:55,621
manages to get himself
wedged back pretty good.

402
00:26:55,638 --> 00:26:57,632
I couldn't make this shit up.

403
00:26:57,646 --> 00:27:00,563
Medics come,
pronounce him right then and there.

404
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:05,532
But get this - they can't pry the guy
out without grabbing hold of his neck
for leverage.

405
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:06,622
We watched them do it.

406
00:27:06,637 --> 00:27:11,530
This Dundalk medic and the morgue guy
just grab his neck and start yanking.

407
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:15,421
Finally they get him out, he comes
down here looking like a strangle job.

408
00:27:15,437 --> 00:27:17,430
They can't tell
that it's postmort?

409
00:27:17,446 --> 00:27:19,412
On a fresh body, no one can.

410
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:21,521
Grab a guy too hard,
and you can cause petechiae,

411
00:27:21,537 --> 00:27:24,513
break a hyoid,
even leave bruising,

412
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:25,631
all after death.

413
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:27,481
Fuck me.

414
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:30,561
Yeah. So Infante's
about to lose his mind

415
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:33,430
if he can't talk this thing
out of becoming a murder.

416
00:27:33,446 --> 00:27:36,401
Either that or charge
the paramedic.

417
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,553
You goin' across the
street for breakfast?

418
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:41,413
- Buy me some scrapple, sailor?
- Come on.

419
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:45,620
ALL BAGS WILL BE SEARCHED
PRIOR TO LEAVING

420
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:47,570
Number two.

421
00:28:29,496 --> 00:28:30,620
Surprise.

422
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:37,422
My man Sergei thought
we should talk first.

423
00:28:37,436 --> 00:28:38,592
Talk about what?

424
00:28:38,607 --> 00:28:40,163
That's on you, young 'un.

425
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:42,433
Whatever business you tryin'
to do through the Russians,

426
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:43,752
you got to go through me first.

427
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:45,533
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

428
00:28:45,546 --> 00:28:49,540
'Cause up in this bitch here,
I'm what you might consider...

429
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:53,413
an authority figure.

430
00:28:53,428 --> 00:28:55,630
You know, everybody got to
get my help or ask my advice,

431
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:57,581
like, on all kinds of shit.

432
00:28:57,596 --> 00:29:01,532
Sergei step to me the other
day sayin' this nigger Marlo,

433
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:05,493
who he don't even know,
just be sending him cash money

434
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:07,483
to get on his visiting list.

435
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,442
So, then he ask me
if I knew Marlo.

436
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,543
I tell him, "Hell, yeah,
I know Marlo real well."

437
00:29:12,557 --> 00:29:16,432
You know? Over Westside,
everybody know everybody, right?

438
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:20,440
Let me help you
find your tongue.

439
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,563
You tryin' to get to the Russian so
you can get a line to his people.

440
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:26,421
You tryin' to get to
the Greek motherfuckers

441
00:29:26,438 --> 00:29:29,573
because if you can you want
to cut Proposition Joe

442
00:29:29,588 --> 00:29:33,470
and all them other Eastside
bitches out the connect.

443
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:36,472
I mean,
you a natural businessman, right?

444
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:38,573
But this is the thing,
though, and I mean, you know,

445
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:41,400
I'm with you on all that as
far as it goes, you know?

446
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:44,463
Westside definitely need to stick
together, you know what I mean?

447
00:29:44,476 --> 00:29:47,462
And all the fuss about
you comin' at me -

448
00:29:47,478 --> 00:29:52,450
I say let bygones be bygones,
but fuck all them Eastside bitches.

449
00:29:52,617 --> 00:29:55,513
That's just the way
I feel about it.

450
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,471
I got nothin' but love in my
heart for Westside niggers,

451
00:29:58,485 --> 00:29:59,580
nothin' but love.

452
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:03,451
Of course, I mean, you know,

453
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:05,612
I got to have my taste too.

454
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:07,483
Figured that.

455
00:30:07,497 --> 00:30:11,423
So send my sister
a hundred large,

456
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:15,510
and the next time you come to Jessup,
it won't be my grill talkin' at you.

457
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:17,621
My word on that.

458
00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:19,633
A hundred large, huh?

459
00:30:21,427 --> 00:30:24,423
So what's up, man?
What's up with you otherwise, you know?

460
00:30:24,435 --> 00:30:26,432
The game is the game.

461
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:29,412
Always.

462
00:30:30,486 --> 00:30:33,641
They do not.
You're making that shit up.

463
00:30:34,405 --> 00:30:36,591
- I'm looking for you, Jimmy.
- Hey, what's up?

464
00:30:36,606 --> 00:30:38,603
You know Nancy Porter
from the County?

465
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:40,630
- Lester Freamon.
- Good to meet you.

466
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,602
Well, thanks for breakfast.

467
00:30:43,617 --> 00:30:45,613
I'll see you downstairs.

468
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:50,470
I spent last night sitting on
that same McCulloh Street lot.

469
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:52,513
- They went back there?
- Twice.

470
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:55,631
Once in the early evening
and once again after three.

471
00:30:56,536 --> 00:31:00,573
They're getting sloppy, Jimmy,
especially now they think we've
backed away.

472
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:07,403
You know, a few good bugs,
a couple of small surveillance cameras,

473
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:10,581
some man hours, two weeks,
three the most.

474
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:13,453
that's all this
fucking case needs.

475
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:16,590
Daniels can't give us that.
He made that pretty fucking clear.

476
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:20,482
Then we go elsewhere.

477
00:31:21,576 --> 00:31:25,560
Right field, number 21,
Nick Markakis.

478
00:31:25,577 --> 00:31:28,611
Going to the game?
Long-time O's fan?

479
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,613
I could care less about
opening day at this point.

480
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:34,400
Between Bud Selig and Barry Bonds,
they've ruined baseball for me.

481
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,542
- You have a minute to talk?
- Late to meet somebody.

482
00:31:36,576 --> 00:31:40,440
How can you commit to a sport where the
commissioner justifies a labor lockout

483
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,632
and cancels the World Series?

484
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:43,590
How long you been an O's fan?

485
00:31:43,607 --> 00:31:48,540
Actually, I grew up with the Cubs,
but my son, he kind of likes them so...

486
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,523
And then on steroids, which has
destroyed what's left of
baseball's credibility,

487
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:54,403
he's nowhere to be found.

488
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:56,550
So, you an Orioles fan?

489
00:31:56,566 --> 00:32:00,553
Are you excited that it's opening
day because something like that is...

490
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:02,511
Fuck baseball!

491
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:06,491
Peanuts! Get your peanuts!

492
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,530
VIVA HOUSE Baltimore
Catholic Worker

493
00:32:15,457 --> 00:32:18,550
51, 52, 53.

494
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:27,423
Hey, Bubs, how you doin'? Have a seat
all the way around the other side.

495
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:28,541
Much obliged.

496
00:32:48,637 --> 00:32:51,491
Stop crying.
Don't grab stuff off my plate.

497
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:53,501
Mommy's going to whup you.

498
00:32:54,578 --> 00:32:56,553
Do you need some help here?

499
00:32:56,568 --> 00:32:58,601
Because we don't do that here.

500
00:32:58,618 --> 00:33:02,570
In our house, there's no hitting anyone,
especially children.

501
00:33:02,588 --> 00:33:04,580
Do you understand me?

502
00:33:21,456 --> 00:33:23,602
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic's a nightmare.

503
00:33:38,585 --> 00:33:41,580
Think you're funny, huh?
Think I still don't have...

504
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:51,561
All right,
I get the point, fuckholes.

505
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:02,523
Fuck you both, already.

506
00:34:02,537 --> 00:34:04,942
A couple more years of this,
you'll be ready for a radio car.

507
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:07,680
Why is it you can't come up to my
office and do this like grown-ups?

508
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:11,501
They still make you sign in at
the front desk out Woodlawn?

509
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:13,463
Who'd you knuckleheads
piss on this time?

510
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:16,601
We're still working the edges of
something the bosses shut down.

511
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:19,581
- Yeah, what are we talking about?
- The bodies in the vacants.

512
00:34:19,598 --> 00:34:21,502
They shut that down?

513
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:24,602
Jesus Christ.
What, 22 murders doesn't rate?

514
00:34:24,616 --> 00:34:26,610
Not any more.

515
00:34:26,628 --> 00:34:29,532
You were on it more than a year.
Where were you?

516
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:32,411
Too close to quit.

517
00:34:32,427 --> 00:34:37,481
You know Marlo Stanfield,
Chris Partlow, Snoop Pearson?

518
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:38,633
Those names ring out.

519
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:41,583
Well, we got nothing
back from any lab work,

520
00:34:41,596 --> 00:34:44,643
there's no witnesses,
nothing to make a murder prosecution,

521
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:48,482
so we settled in,
sat on them for about a year.

522
00:34:48,496 --> 00:34:50,570
- You got a pattern?
- A good one.

523
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:53,340
Two or three weeks with some
good FBI cameras and wires,

524
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:54,562
maybe a half-dozen agents...

525
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:57,450
Like we tell you boys
when the case broke,

526
00:34:57,466 --> 00:34:59,562
we aren't much into ghetto
drug shit any more.

527
00:34:59,576 --> 00:35:02,123
Most of our guys are counter-terror
and political stuff.

528
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:03,572
We already did all
the long legwork.

529
00:35:03,605 --> 00:35:06,402
Two or three weeks,
you guys end up with a big headline.

530
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:08,482
You federal fucks
like headlines.

531
00:35:09,597 --> 00:35:11,591
I'll run it up the flagpole.

532
00:35:12,537 --> 00:35:14,501
- I'm gonna drive away now.
- All right.

533
00:35:14,517 --> 00:35:16,513
If it's OK with
you two suckholes.

534
00:35:23,226 --> 00:35:24,403
Welcome back to Camden Yards.

535
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:26,361
As we mentioned a moment ago,
the Orioles know...

536
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,422
I got good stuff.

537
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:30,570
Hang on. Come here and tell me,
so I can put it on the budget.

538
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:32,562
I got a kid in a wheelchair
outside the stadium,

539
00:35:32,578 --> 00:35:33,621
wanting to go to the game

540
00:35:33,637 --> 00:35:36,472
but unable because he didn't have
the money for a scalped ticket.

541
00:35:36,488 --> 00:35:38,480
Sounds pretty good.
You got art?

542
00:35:38,497 --> 00:35:40,593
Photo said they were too
booked with the game.

543
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:42,372
This is your main colour piece.

544
00:35:42,388 --> 00:35:44,601
You got to have a picture of
the kid if he's your lead.

545
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:46,573
- Can we send them out now?
- I guess.

546
00:35:46,588 --> 00:35:49,620
- He probably rolled out, but you can try.
- Shit.

547
00:35:49,638 --> 00:35:51,541
- How old is this fella?
- 13.

548
00:35:51,558 --> 00:35:53,550
What's with his parents?
Why wasn't he in school?

549
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:55,513
What, in this city?
He just cut.

550
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,482
- So what about his parents?
- Both dead. No shit.

551
00:35:57,496 --> 00:36:00,543
- He lives with his aunt in West Baltimore.
- How'd he get in the wheelchair?

552
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:03,272
Something about a stray gunshot.
It was all pretty vague.

553
00:36:03,285 --> 00:36:04,552
You got a date
when it happened?

554
00:36:04,585 --> 00:36:06,572
He was a little hinky
with telling me much.

555
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:08,580
Fact is, he would only let
me go with his nickname.

556
00:36:08,598 --> 00:36:11,590
Look. I got to start writing
if you want it for the e-dot.

557
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:15,530
Yeah. Why don't you work in Metro
Write so I can read over your shoulder?

558
00:36:15,547 --> 00:36:18,430
Hey, Scott.
What he go by, the nickname?

559
00:36:18,448 --> 00:36:20,500
- E.J.
- E.J.

560
00:36:22,498 --> 00:36:24,432
Hey, Jane, come here a minute.

561
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:28,423
Check clips for the
last three years.

562
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,511
See if we got anything on a kid in
the city wounded by a stray bullet.

563
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:35,431
He'd be 13 now. Nickname of E.J.
Could be his initials.

564
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:36,441
Who is he to us?

565
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:39,510
He's the lead of our opening-day piece.
I'd love to get art on the kid.

566
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:41,520
Don't hold your breath.

567
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,403
It's a hell of a case, really.

568
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,433
And God knows they
could use the help.

569
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,590
- Sorry I'm late.
- Anything up?

570
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,630
- Just the usual. You all right?
- Yeah.

571
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,543
We do this right,
it is like a spiral.

572
00:37:19,557 --> 00:37:23,461
We start on the outside of the circle,
and we work our way around the edges,

573
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:27,430
pick up everything we can before we get
to Clay and the people he keeps close.

574
00:37:27,448 --> 00:37:29,200
You think Clay knows
the indictment's coming?

575
00:37:29,408 --> 00:37:33,443
Clay Davis has been waiting for the
other shoe to drop his whole life.

576
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:37,420
He knows.

577
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:38,833
And it's your people
up in my shit.

578
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:42,423
Not no feds,
not no state people from Annapolis.

579
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:44,302
It's motherfuckers
from my own city.

580
00:37:44,316 --> 00:37:45,602
My hands are tied
here, Clayton.

581
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:48,441
It's a new mayor,
a new state's attorney.

582
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:51,531
I'm out there doing the Lord's
work for you, Erv. You know it.

583
00:37:51,547 --> 00:37:54,403
Who got that pay raise
through the council?

584
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:56,452
Just enough for you
to get that new patio

585
00:37:56,468 --> 00:37:59,412
but not enough for that guy from
Pittsburgh to take your place.

586
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:00,542
I wish I could.

587
00:38:00,555 --> 00:38:04,563
You know I wish I could, but with
Carcetti in, people are watching.

588
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:06,212
I got eyes on me now.

589
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:07,600
You the commissioner
still, right?

590
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:09,593
Yeah, but it ain't like it was.

591
00:38:09,607 --> 00:38:11,521
If you don't control it,
who does?

592
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:15,611
On this, I got to reach around Daniels,
and he's Carcetti's boy.

593
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:20,563
Look. This is a grand jury
investigation, for God's sake.

594
00:38:20,577 --> 00:38:24,551
We could both be charged
with obstruction of justice.

595
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:25,593
God damn it, Erv.

596
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:28,631
I been there for you, carried water
for you, and you do me like this?

597
00:38:28,646 --> 00:38:32,483
Clay, I can't. Nobody could.

598
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:35,622
You think I'm goin' down,
don't you?

599
00:38:35,638 --> 00:38:39,400
You think I'm done.

600
00:38:39,415 --> 00:38:42,542
All y'all ungrateful bitches thinkin'
you can throw me out the boat.

601
00:38:42,555 --> 00:38:44,580
- Clay.
- A'ight!

602
00:38:44,595 --> 00:38:46,602
I'm gonna remember
this moment, Erv.

603
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,643
I'm gonna hold on to
this moment. Yeah.

604
00:39:00,626 --> 00:39:02,493
Clay crying to you?

605
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,602
Like I could put
brakes on this mess.

606
00:39:04,615 --> 00:39:06,412
Is that...

607
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,480
Yeah. Straight from P and R.

608
00:39:09,536 --> 00:39:11,643
And that's with the numbers
bent as far as we dare.

609
00:39:12,408 --> 00:39:16,450
With city hall asking for clean stats,
there's only so much we can do.

610
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:18,470
The hell are we
gonna tell the mayor?

611
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:25,621
I sat there for half an hour
with him and his deputy.

612
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:27,513
He knows what he's
saying no to.

613
00:39:27,525 --> 00:39:29,592
- Then how the fuck...
- It's personal, Jimmy.

614
00:39:29,607 --> 00:39:32,490
Somebody at city hall really
pissed off the US Attorney.

615
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:35,483
- You're kidding me.
- No, and I got an earful.

616
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:38,523
You tell Lester I'm still trying
to figure out what the problem is,

617
00:39:38,535 --> 00:39:42,403
but for right now, you forget
about shopping this case anywhere.

618
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:46,560
DEA, ATF, Customs -
you guys are shut out across the board.

619
00:39:47,565 --> 00:39:49,613
Fish and fucking Wildlife
couldn't help you.

620
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:51,523
Sorry, brother.

621
00:39:54,536 --> 00:39:56,520
The kid is nowhere to be found.

622
00:39:56,535 --> 00:39:59,531
I sent photo down there to
try to dig him up. Nothing.

623
00:39:59,546 --> 00:40:01,410
- Probably left.
- OK.

624
00:40:01,426 --> 00:40:04,382
So we got a poor black kid in
a wheelchair with no ticket.

625
00:40:04,395 --> 00:40:06,591
He rolls himself from somewhere
in West Baltimore to...

626
00:40:06,626 --> 00:40:10,620
to "the shadow of the mighty brick-faced
coliseum known as Oriole Park,

627
00:40:10,635 --> 00:40:14,593
"listening to the cheers from the crowd,
which told the whole tale."

628
00:40:14,606 --> 00:40:18,361
We're gonna give good play to a
13-year-old known only as E.J,

629
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,600
who declines to give his name
because he skipped school,

630
00:40:20,637 --> 00:40:23,212
he's got no parents,
he lives with his aunt.

631
00:40:23,228 --> 00:40:25,590
I'm not saying that this kid
isn't everything you say he is,

632
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,571
but, Scott, damn, as an editor,

633
00:40:27,587 --> 00:40:30,421
I need a little more to go on
if I'm gonna fly this thing.

634
00:40:30,438 --> 00:40:31,590
I resent the implication.

635
00:40:31,608 --> 00:40:34,483
I'm not implying anything.
I'm on your side.

636
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,463
But the standard
for us has to be...

637
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,630
Scott, just finished
your story.

638
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:42,412
Good read.
I'm putting it out front.

639
00:40:42,428 --> 00:40:45,573
I think you've really captured the
disparity of the two worlds in this city

640
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:48,540
in a highly readable narrative.
I wouldn't change a word.

641
00:40:48,557 --> 00:40:51,581
Thanks, but I'm not sure
everyone shares your enthusiasm.

642
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:53,521
Jim, aren't you just
a little bit concerned

643
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:55,530
that we don't even have
a last name for this kid?

644
00:40:55,548 --> 00:40:57,512
I thought we held
ourselves up to a...

645
00:40:57,528 --> 00:40:59,591
It's not an ideal
situation, no,

646
00:40:59,606 --> 00:41:02,503
but the boy's reluctance
to give his last name

647
00:41:02,517 --> 00:41:06,411
clearly stems from his fear of
being discovered as a truant.

648
00:41:06,427 --> 00:41:07,571
You have a problem with it?

649
00:41:07,587 --> 00:41:11,421
A little bit, yeah. I'm just
saying that the standards that...

650
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,430
I think we're on
terra firma here.

651
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:18,432
Gotcha.

652
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:20,551
The man made a call.
You're good to go.

653
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:22,433
Thanks, Scott.

654
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:29,463
The nigger Webster's
shop right there.

655
00:41:29,476 --> 00:41:33,591
So look, I'm gonna roll up,
and y'all gonna pop out and pop off.

656
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:35,431
Drop who you can.

657
00:41:35,448 --> 00:41:39,431
Yo. Let's go all West
Coast with this.

658
00:41:41,616 --> 00:41:43,470
Say what?

659
00:41:43,488 --> 00:41:46,420
Drive-by. That's how they do.

660
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:48,512
Drop a motherfucker
and not slow down.

661
00:41:48,528 --> 00:41:50,580
Like Boyz N The Hood.

662
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:52,481
Shit was tight, remember?

663
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:01,482
- Yo, there you go.
- What's up?

664
00:42:09,437 --> 00:42:11,581
Man, I ain't even
hit near one of them.

665
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:13,552
This nigger's wound.

666
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:21,561
Fuck them West Coast niggers,

667
00:42:21,596 --> 00:42:24,562
'cause in B-more,
we aim to hit a nigger, you heard.

668
00:42:31,538 --> 00:42:34,482
Guy leaves two dozen bodies
scattered all over the city,

669
00:42:34,495 --> 00:42:36,553
no one gives a fuck.

670
00:42:36,565 --> 00:42:38,571
It's because who he dropped.

671
00:42:38,585 --> 00:42:40,431
True that.

672
00:42:40,447 --> 00:42:44,402
You can go a long way in this
country killing black folk.

673
00:42:44,415 --> 00:42:46,482
Young males especially.

674
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,451
Misdemeanour homicides.

675
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,411
If Marlo was
killing white women.

676
00:42:50,425 --> 00:42:51,503
White children.

677
00:42:51,516 --> 00:42:52,532
Tourists.

678
00:42:54,577 --> 00:42:58,530
One white ex-cheerleader
tourist missing in Aruba.

679
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:01,411
Trouble is,
this ain't Aruba, bitch.

680
00:43:02,588 --> 00:43:06,592
You think that if 300 white people
were killed in this city every year,

681
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:10,542
they wouldn't send
the 82nd Airborne?

682
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:12,152
Negro, please.

683
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:14,501
There's got to be some way to
make them turn on the faucet.

684
00:43:14,515 --> 00:43:18,400
Come on, Jimmy.
You're the smartest boy in the room.

685
00:43:18,418 --> 00:43:20,572
You come up with something
in this broke-ass city.

686
00:43:30,635 --> 00:43:33,433
Isn't he married
or some shit now?

687
00:43:39,447 --> 00:43:41,582
Did you edit this
opening-day piece?

688
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:47,522
Whiting himself blessed it as written
before I could take a meat ax to it.

689
00:43:47,538 --> 00:43:50,491
Did it bother you that we
don't have the boy's full name?

690
00:43:50,508 --> 00:43:52,502
Yes, Rebecca, it did.

691
00:43:54,606 --> 00:43:56,501
Don't give me that "huh".

692
00:43:56,518 --> 00:43:58,470
Whiting wasn't buying
any problem I had.

693
00:43:58,488 --> 00:44:00,521
No art of the kid?

694
00:44:02,628 --> 00:44:04,461
None.

695
00:44:10,617 --> 00:44:12,611
How long we been here?

696
00:44:14,627 --> 00:44:16,543
More than a hour.

697
00:44:16,556 --> 00:44:18,550
Why you think we sitting here?

698
00:44:19,627 --> 00:44:25,423
See who home and who not,
who on the block,

699
00:44:25,436 --> 00:44:26,603
police and whatnot.

700
00:44:26,618 --> 00:44:28,550
That's right.

701
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:31,641
You don't ever want to be the
last man to a party. You feel me?

702
00:44:33,597 --> 00:44:37,480
That's why I show up to
a job an hour before.

703
00:44:37,497 --> 00:44:39,453
Sometimes two.

704
00:44:40,558 --> 00:44:43,642
I don't want nobody settin' up on
me while I'm settin' up on them.

705
00:44:44,607 --> 00:44:49,613
'Cause there ain't no good thing about
motherfuckin' surprises in this line
of work.

706
00:44:51,586 --> 00:44:54,482
Why we doin' June Bug anyway?

707
00:44:54,495 --> 00:44:56,611
Heard he called
Marlo a dicksuck.

708
00:44:56,628 --> 00:44:59,522
Talkin' shit like that.

709
00:44:59,535 --> 00:45:02,552
You heard? You ain't sure?

710
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:04,612
People say he said it.

711
00:45:05,515 --> 00:45:09,410
Don't matter if he said it or not.
People think he said it.

712
00:45:09,427 --> 00:45:10,602
Can't let that shit go.

713
00:45:10,615 --> 00:45:12,630
Why not?

714
00:45:12,646 --> 00:45:16,522
I mean,
Marlo ain't suck no dick, right?

715
00:45:18,525 --> 00:45:21,532
So, if Marlo knows
he ain't suck dick,

716
00:45:21,545 --> 00:45:23,621
then what the fuck he
care what June Bug say?

717
00:45:23,635 --> 00:45:25,631
What anybody say?

718
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:29,610
Why this boy got to get dead,
just for talking shit?

719
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:32,560
'Cause he got a big motherfuckin' mouth,
that's why,

720
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:36,420
and you need to stop runnin'
your own mouth, young 'un.

721
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:42,540
There it is.

722
00:45:42,556 --> 00:45:44,542
And all the muscle he got.

723
00:45:44,556 --> 00:45:47,551
- See it?
- You ready?

724
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:50,631
Now you handle that thing.

725
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:53,312
You give me a sign,
meet me out front.

726
00:45:53,326 --> 00:45:54,612
Michael, you go
round the alley.

727
00:45:54,647 --> 00:45:57,643
Body come bustin' out the back,
you drop that shit.

728
00:46:28,626 --> 00:46:30,641
CITIWATCH BELIEVE

729
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:32,600
Shitfuck.

730
00:46:33,546 --> 00:46:36,510
Bunk's usually the
one throwing up.

731
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:38,462
You took aspirin?

732
00:46:38,475 --> 00:46:39,572
Six.

733
00:46:40,617 --> 00:46:43,481
How was that brunette?

734
00:46:43,495 --> 00:46:46,523
Must have been a decent ride
'cause he never went home.

735
00:46:48,437 --> 00:46:50,431
Same shirt as yesterday, Jimmy.

736
00:46:54,627 --> 00:46:57,442
You catchin' hell from Beadie?

737
00:46:58,426 --> 00:46:59,473
No.

738
00:46:59,488 --> 00:47:00,572
Just asking.

739
00:47:00,586 --> 00:47:02,511
Gentlemen.

740
00:47:02,527 --> 00:47:04,480
DOA, Central and Baltimore.

741
00:47:04,496 --> 00:47:07,533
- I took a call two days ago.
- The old lady?

742
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:09,602
That wasn't a call.
That came back natural.

743
00:47:09,617 --> 00:47:11,612
Look. I'm hung over, Jay.

744
00:47:15,568 --> 00:47:18,431
Both of you. You're up.

745
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,403
Mommy. Mommy!

746
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:13,642
'Sup, Boris?

747
00:48:14,646 --> 00:48:16,463
You know who I am?

748
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:20,412
I'm that rich uncle been putting all
that money in your canteen account.

749
00:48:23,576 --> 00:48:27,503
In my country,
I was in jail four years.

750
00:48:28,546 --> 00:48:32,563
In my country,
this is not prison.

751
00:48:34,438 --> 00:48:36,433
This is nothing.

752
00:48:37,427 --> 00:48:39,522
I don't need money.

753
00:48:39,538 --> 00:48:41,640
I don't need fucking canteen.

754
00:48:44,427 --> 00:48:46,422
I don't need you.

755
00:48:50,515 --> 00:48:53,423
- Gangbanger.
- A'ight. I feel that.

756
00:48:53,437 --> 00:48:56,610
I feel that,
but Avon over there,

757
00:48:56,627 --> 00:49:00,470
he thinks you might be able to
help get a message to the Greeks,

758
00:49:00,486 --> 00:49:01,630
to Vondas.

759
00:49:08,426 --> 00:49:10,532
I mean,
seeing as you don't need my money,

760
00:49:12,635 --> 00:49:15,413
Vondas might be
happy to have it.

761
00:49:17,615 --> 00:49:21,500
He don't want to see me,
he won't,

762
00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:26,411
but if he do,
it's you that made it happen.

763
00:49:47,636 --> 00:49:49,633
Hey. Hey, man.

764
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:58,440
Sonny Mays is running late.

765
00:49:58,458 --> 00:50:00,453
Can you fill in as speaker?

766
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:03,522
It's time to share, Bubs.

767
00:50:04,478 --> 00:50:07,532
Nah, I don't think so.
I'm not feeling so good today, you know?

768
00:50:07,548 --> 00:50:10,430
As your sponsor,
I'm telling you,

769
00:50:10,445 --> 00:50:12,532
you got to step
up for something.

770
00:50:12,545 --> 00:50:16,403
I don't care what, I don't care
if it's in these rooms or not,

771
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:18,611
but there ain't no laying
in the cut on this shit.

772
00:50:18,626 --> 00:50:21,403
You got to step up somewhere.

773
00:50:34,425 --> 00:50:35,642
Detective, can I get a word?

774
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,461
Anything? Anything
on the suspects?

775
00:50:39,598 --> 00:50:41,591
Maybe on your way out, then.

776
00:50:49,585 --> 00:50:51,623
Back door was open.

777
00:50:51,637 --> 00:50:54,532
Can't tell if he ran
through and out the rear.

778
00:50:55,557 --> 00:50:58,482
They. Unless the shooter
put a bullet in her head

779
00:50:58,497 --> 00:51:00,462
for good measure
after the shotgun.

780
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:03,561
Also, two of our street cameras
were disabled. Wires ripped.

781
00:51:03,577 --> 00:51:06,420
Fuck. That's a whole
lot of thinking

782
00:51:06,437 --> 00:51:09,442
for any motherfucker to
do something like this.

783
00:51:22,407 --> 00:51:24,402
How the fuck?

784
00:51:27,497 --> 00:51:29,411
How?

785
00:51:29,428 --> 00:51:32,541
He must have been in that closet
the whole time. No one heard shit.

786
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:35,410
Call DSS. Now.

787
00:51:36,428 --> 00:51:38,513
Any media out back?

788
00:51:38,525 --> 00:51:40,483
Bring a cage car around.

789
00:51:58,488 --> 00:52:00,612
Hey. How you doing?

790
00:52:00,628 --> 00:52:03,500
Look, I don't know
what I can do to help.

791
00:52:03,518 --> 00:52:04,753
I'm just tryin' to find my way.

792
00:52:05,406 --> 00:52:09,462
Seein' how crowded it is,
maybe I could help you hand out tickets.

793
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:12,642
That's fine, Bubs, really,
but wouldn't you rather serve?

794
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:15,513
Serve lunch.

795
00:52:15,528 --> 00:52:17,442
You mean give the
food to people?

796
00:52:17,457 --> 00:52:19,473
Isn't that the best part?

797
00:52:19,488 --> 00:52:21,401
Nah, I can't. No.

798
00:52:21,417 --> 00:52:23,512
All right. Come on.

799
00:52:23,525 --> 00:52:25,522
We can always use an
extra set of hands.

800
00:52:30,505 --> 00:52:32,472
He fell out.

801
00:52:32,488 --> 00:52:34,561
Last bottle of smoke
probably did him in.

802
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:36,612
Another drunk found him,
pulled me off post.

803
00:52:36,626 --> 00:52:39,500
10-7 when I arrived.

804
00:52:39,516 --> 00:52:43,561
- You call for a crime lab?
- The wait's two to three hours.

805
00:52:43,576 --> 00:52:45,572
Shit gets worse every day.

806
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,533
Jimmy?

807
00:52:57,427 --> 00:52:58,622
You OK?

808
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:04,613
Go get yourself a coffee, do your
paperwork, get back on the street.

809
00:53:04,627 --> 00:53:06,571
We got it from here.

810
00:53:06,586 --> 00:53:09,533
We're gonna wait on them anyway.
Go ahead.

811
00:53:09,546 --> 00:53:11,441
Thanks.

812
00:53:13,568 --> 00:53:15,492
Don't let this guy go anywhere.

813
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:17,541
I forgot something in the car.

814
00:53:18,577 --> 00:53:20,582
Bring the paper in, will you?

815
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,592
We're gonna be here a while.

816
00:54:45,536 --> 00:54:47,461
Hey.

817
00:54:53,578 --> 00:54:55,511
Little early for that,
ain't it?

818
00:55:04,446 --> 00:55:05,641
What the fuck you doing?

819
00:55:06,405 --> 00:55:08,411
Just watch the door, Bunk.

820
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,460
Shit.

821
00:55:15,427 --> 00:55:16,553
Come on, Jimmy.

822
00:55:16,565 --> 00:55:18,513
Get a fuckin' grip.

823
00:55:27,466 --> 00:55:28,573
Jimmy.

824
00:55:36,486 --> 00:55:38,492
Have you lost your
fucking mind?

825
00:56:01,637 --> 00:56:04,592
Jesus Christ, you sick fuck.

826
00:56:15,648 --> 00:56:18,403
There's a serial
killer in Baltimore.

827
00:56:19,475 --> 00:56:21,563
He preys on the
weakest among us.

828
00:56:21,575 --> 00:56:23,572
He needs to be caught.

829
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:29,630
I'm going.

830
00:56:29,645 --> 00:56:31,622
I don't want a part of this.

831
00:57:18,647 --> 00:57:21,620
