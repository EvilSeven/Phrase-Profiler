1
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:28,066
They got honey nut
Cheerios in here?

2
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:29,304
Shit.

3
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:41,132
Yo, back the fuck up,
motherfucker.

4
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:42,979
My man here saved my spot, yo.

5
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:54,089
So we'll have
more time together.

6
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:56,145
Get us a couple of babies.

7
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:18,848
Ain't nobody see shit.

8
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:28,031
How's that for a message?

9
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:29,112
Not bad.

10
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:31,930
Except the price in your head
ain't for 4 figures. It's for 5.

11
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:34,775
Shit. For that kind of money,
I should have done you my own self.

12
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:36,813
So who's doing the bounty?

13
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:39,264
Who it is-- a west-side player
by the name of Marlow.

14
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,472
Marlow?

15
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:41,817
Can't say I know the man.

16
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:42,949
He know you.

17
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,605
You can get me a phone call?

18
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:46,605
I can do you one
better than that.

19
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:52,284
Who you calling?

20
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:54,970
Police.

21
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:56,272
The police?

22
00:02:57,498 --> 00:02:58,687
Man owe me a favor.

23
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,981
4x07 Unto Others

24
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,325
<i>...crime, violence, drugs,</i>

25
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:52,292
<i>drug addiction, failing schools,</i>

26
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,492
<i>all of these social</i>
<i>problems in Baltimore city.</i>

27
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:56,958
<i>Over and over again.</i>

28
00:04:57,025 --> 00:05:00,212
<i>And on June 8, when I had to</i>
<i>write a column for the next day,</i>

29
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:03,991
<i>some statistics had just come</i>
<i>out from the FBI showing</i>

30
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:06,015
<i>an up-tick in some</i>
<i>of Baltimore's crime,</i>

31
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:08,591
<i>and we also had a spate of 5 killings</i>

32
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,792
<i>in a 2 or 3-day period.</i>

33
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:13,858
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>the idea of sitting down again</i>

34
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:16,558
<i>and writing another column</i>
<i>on this subject--</i>

35
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,525
<i>I don't know if it is important.</i>

36
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:20,358
<i>But here I am a citizen of Baltimore,</i>

37
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:24,023
<i>and I take my citizenship as seriously</i>
<i>as I take my credentials as a columnist.</i>

38
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:27,891
<i>I said, "what am I gonna say?</i>
<i>What can I say about this?"</i>

39
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:29,557
<i>If the killings continue,</i>

40
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:32,956
<i>between 250 and 300</i>
<i>homicides a year...</i>

41
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:35,273
Top of the world.

42
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:37,461
I knocked off an
incumbent major, Tony.

43
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:38,593
That ain't easy.

44
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:41,056
National party
has to take note of this.

45
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:44,801
Young and pretty as you are,
I'm sure they've got ideas.

46
00:05:45,537 --> 00:05:47,885
All you have to do now
is run the city.

47
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:50,451
Tony, I gotta ask
you something--

48
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,715
Why you didn't run again
after the first term.

49
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:54,596
I mean, nobody had the--

50
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,723
The name you had, the organization.

51
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:59,132
Let me tell you a story, Tommy.

52
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:03,289
The first day I became mayor,
they set me down at the desk,

53
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:08,277
Big chair and dark wood,
lots of beautiful things.

54
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:12,162
I'm thinking,
"how much better can it get?"

55
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:16,041
There's a knock at the door
in the corner of the room,

56
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:18,067
and Pete comes walking in

57
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:23,504
carrying this gorgeous sieve
silver bowl, hand chased.

58
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:25,315
It was this big.

59
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:27,988
"It's from the unions," he says.

60
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:29,646
So I think it's a present,

61
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,822
something to commemorate
my first day as mayor.

62
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:35,455
And he walks over,
puts it on a desk.

63
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:37,272
I look down at it.

64
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:39,928
It's disgusting.

65
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:42,437
I say,
"what the hell is this?"

66
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:45,630
He said,
"what the hell's it look like?"

67
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:48,298
I said, "it looks like shit.

68
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,087
Well, what do you want
me to do with it?"

69
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:53,729
He says, "eat it."

70
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:55,719
"Eat it?"

71
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:57,087
He says, "yeah.

72
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,849
You're the mayor.

73
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:00,453
You gotta eat it."

74
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:02,417
So, OK.

75
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:05,353
It was my first day,
and Pete knows more than I do.

76
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:06,820
So I go at it.

77
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:10,744
And just when I finish,
there's a knock on the door.

78
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:14,586
And in walks Pete carrying
another silver bowl,

79
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:16,219
and this one's from the blacks.

80
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:17,420
"This, too?"

81
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:18,681
And he nods.

82
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,218
I start eating.

83
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,686
And when I'm finished,

84
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:24,331
there's another knock
and another bowl.

85
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,186
This one's from the pollacks.

86
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:29,869
Then after that,
one from the ministers.

87
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:31,318
And you know what, Tommy?

88
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:32,752
That's what it is.

89
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:36,816
You're sitting eating shit
all day long, day after day,

90
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,199
Year after year.

91
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,452
When I realized that,

92
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:42,960
I decided
being a downtown lawyer

93
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:47,277
and seeing my family every night
made for a fine life.

94
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:49,906
Just a fine life.

95
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,576
Got that dark horse right here, man.
All jacked up for us.

96
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:03,084
Man, wasn't no...
nigga ain't about to cop, is he?

97
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,181
Spider, Spider, hold on, now.

98
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:09,697
Come on, man.

99
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:13,838
Why you ain't come past
my gym no more?

100
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,933
I been waiting on you for weeks now.

101
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:17,955
Talk to me, son.

102
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:20,209
Leave me the fuck alone.

103
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:24,638
What happened between me
and your moms

104
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:27,789
ain't got shit to do with you
taking advantage of the gym.

105
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:32,172
Now, man, I'm just saying
you one of my best, boy.

106
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,822
If I thought it
was gonna hurt you, I--

107
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:35,859
Fuck you!

108
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:37,673
Ain't nobody gonna hurt me.
Fuck you.

109
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:39,956
So step up and step off, unc.

110
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:42,268
I got customers backing up.

111
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:46,946
Dark horse.

112
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:48,946
Dark horse.

113
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:53,018
5, and 5 more.

114
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:55,048
Shit. That's done.

115
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:56,788
<i>...go to the cafeteria.</i>

116
00:08:57,282 --> 00:08:59,382
<i>Principal Withers,</i>
<i>please to the cafeteria.</i>

117
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:00,716
Last card down. Remember?

118
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:01,896
Oh, yeah. My bad.

119
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:10,069
Hey, guys.

120
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:12,808
You know I don't mind you
coming up here most days

121
00:09:12,846 --> 00:09:16,148
to eat lunch, but
I said you can't be gambling.

122
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:20,281
Yo, Mr. Pryzbo, quarter's
only a, you know, reminder--

123
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:22,481
to remind me that I got
25 shells.

124
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,681
That's all.

125
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:25,681
Come on.
Let's see what you got.

126
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,818
Dang. Flush.

127
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:29,544
But it don't beat
your three 9s, right?

128
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:31,183
- Yeah, it do.
- It do?

129
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:32,446
It do.

130
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:34,117
It does.

131
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,093
Karim, you should have been
more cautious with your bet.

132
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,150
Figure the odds.

133
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:40,647
Yo, it's our lunch break.
Don't be schooling us now.

134
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,269
Hold on. Hold on.
Let him talk.

135
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:43,985
Well, for starters,

136
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:46,347
you have to get
a count on the diamonds.

137
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:49,029
You know how many diamonds
there are in a deck?

138
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:50,288
13.

139
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:51,640
13. That's right.

140
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:53,614
Cards is all about
knowing the numbers.

141
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,547
The numbers you can
calculate the odds.

142
00:09:56,076 --> 00:09:58,246
Now, Michael had
4 diamonds showing.

143
00:09:58,303 --> 00:10:00,238
Hold on. Wait.
What about dice?

144
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:03,381
I mean, does dice
have odds, too?

145
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:05,945
'Cause mostly
that's what we play.

146
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,413
Dice?
Yeah. Sure.

147
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:11,067
So, can you show us
the odds of dice?

148
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:12,104
Yeah, man.

149
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:13,501
Yeah, man. Teach us dice.

150
00:10:13,556 --> 00:10:15,292
- That'd be hard, man.
- For real.

151
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:17,409
Here comes that jailhouse Rick.

152
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,820
The Braddock case?

153
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,513
I take it we now have permission
to solve this fucking case,

154
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:26,078
Seeing as everyone's
finished voting.

155
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,812
Solve away, you both Centurions!

156
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:38,230
You don't have work to do?

157
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:41,861
Not till I catch a fresh call.

158
00:10:41,978 --> 00:10:42,969
No.

159
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,237
How much can you
sell that one for?

160
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:47,415
Mint condition, 300.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,773
Fuck me.
I need a hobby.

162
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:54,603
That's right.

163
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,264
I bet he bucked on me.

164
00:10:57,394 --> 00:11:00,092
I just thought he might have
come back past once or twice.

165
00:11:00,262 --> 00:11:02,207
Shawn's on a truant list, Mr. Cousins.

166
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,147
He hadn't been back
since the last time you brought him in.

167
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,625
Well, if he does come back past,

168
00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:10,844
Will you tell him I'm
looking for him at home?

169
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:12,865
And he can come
home if he want.

170
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,915
I apologize for taking your time.

171
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,411
I see you up here undercover.

172
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:24,610
All right. Don't worry, dawg.
I'll keep it close.

173
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,703
Mrs. Dolly, does the school have
any kind of collection of board games?

174
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,552
Parcheesi, Trouble, Monopoly?

175
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:38,803
You're still teaching
eighth-grade math, right?

176
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,237
Trying. Yeah.

177
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,078
The book room downstairs.

178
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:51,283
Stay on the curriculum,
Mr. Pryzbylewski,

179
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,016
or you'll have an area
superintendent on our backs.

180
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:56,742
Remember this, yo?

181
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:01,415
Not my case.

182
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,679
Them boys working the case
ain't really in the mood to listen.

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,703
As you can see, I still
got the lady lawyer marker,

184
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:12,156
And if I recall,
police gun got fired a while back.

185
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:14,498
Only reason I'm even here
is because of that gun.

186
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:16,553
As far as Eileen Nathan goes,

187
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:20,191
she promised get out of jail free
on a small felony or two.

188
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:22,948
This here...

189
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:25,269
is a taxpayer murder
with an eyeball witness.

190
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,150
The eyeball witness is lying, yo.

191
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:30,949
Come on. When you ever know me to put my
gun on anybody that wasn't in the gang?

192
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:33,720
Old-Face Andre lying on me here.

193
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,838
The store owner.
Now, why would he lie?

194
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,662
Andre working
a package out the store.

195
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:41,240
Folk like that--
they tend to bear certain resentment

196
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:42,333
toward folk like me.

197
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:44,734
If you didn't do this
when you did others--

198
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:49,217
Shit. I got files
on two open doubles last year.

199
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:51,781
Shotgun shells at both scenes.

200
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:56,739
What about
that stash-house gunfight?

201
00:12:58,598 --> 00:13:01,629
What about Stringer Bell and
his muscle dead in the warehouse?

202
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:05,272
If this one ain't on you,
another dozen probably are.

203
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:09,645
And if this one goes to court,
you can tell that jury how wrong it is.

204
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:16,148
Obviously I got along before
I swear to them on the stand.

205
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:19,904
You leave me at courtside
and I'm done.

206
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:21,706
- You know that.
- Yeah?

207
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:23,083
So you ain't making friends.

208
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,989
I got a bounty
on my head, man.

209
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:26,536
5 figures.

210
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:34,622
If I would have known I'd be
sharing quarters with all these boys,

211
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,754
I probably wouldn't have
robbed so many of them.

212
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:40,910
Oh, yeah.
The golden rule.

213
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:43,933
Well, since you feeling all biblical

214
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:45,933
and righteous and all,
you think on this.

215
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:48,070
Now, if Omar ain't killed
that delivery lady,

216
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:49,503
somebody else did.

217
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:53,112
But you giving him a free walk
right now though, ain't you?

218
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:56,683
A man got to have a code.

219
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:25,038
What's up?

220
00:14:25,874 --> 00:14:26,930
Just the dice.

221
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:29,436
Grab the dice
from any game that has them.

222
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:41,860
We're using that
third edition, right?

223
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:45,494
I don't know.

224
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:47,460
We're using the third.

225
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:50,435
What are the new fifth editions
doing sitting down here in a box?

226
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,013
No way.

227
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:34,997
What's up, man?

228
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:36,280
Got your big yellow.

229
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:37,998
What's up?

230
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:39,816
Big yellow for you.

231
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,767
Look at you,
all business and shit.

232
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:47,177
Big yellow bird.

233
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,232
Yo, who you bumping with?

234
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:51,920
Ain't no bump.

235
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,098
They got their corner.
I got mine.

236
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:55,303
Ain't no thing.

237
00:15:56,432 --> 00:15:57,949
You going up to gym today?

238
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:00,492
I might see you later.

239
00:16:05,154 --> 00:16:06,565
Well, maybe they with Marlow.

240
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,799
Ain't with no one.

241
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:10,088
They're just young'uns
playing in this shit.

242
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,599
So what you want to do?

243
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:13,992
I want to mix here and
bring the police to our shop.

244
00:16:14,351 --> 00:16:15,860
When they step off,
you follow.

245
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:17,331
Bank 'em good.

246
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:18,498
What if they strut?

247
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,164
Ain't no need to pop no one,

248
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:24,331
But they need a warning.

249
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:26,194
Make sure they know we for real.

250
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:27,331
Brokeback, man.

251
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:28,564
Brokeback right here.

252
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:30,698
Fresh from the street.
Brokeback.

253
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,724
Tried to bring out
who was on me.

254
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:38,215
Led him to the train station.

255
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,160
How that work?

256
00:16:43,022 --> 00:16:44,815
Had the railroad police on me.

257
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,868
Couldn't smoke.
I was pulling the strings.

258
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:52,078
You need a name.

259
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,220
You get that,
I can run it down for you.

260
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,550
I'll get a name.

261
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:01,461
Cameron still there?

262
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:05,185
Steal that motherfucker.

263
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,646
No one speaks to it,
then it's the feds sniffing you out.

264
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,362
It's only federals be rich
enough to lose a camera

265
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:13,983
and not go to crying about it.

266
00:17:15,304 --> 00:17:18,870
You steal that bitch and someone
comes knocking, it's local.

267
00:17:20,988 --> 00:17:22,328
Steal that bitch.

268
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,384
See what comes.

269
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:30,528
Hey, you know the boy used
to be with me running these carts?

270
00:17:30,694 --> 00:17:31,996
Go by the name of Sharad.

271
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,506
I'm looking for him.
Some good news.

272
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:37,494
So if you spot him, you know,
tell him to come see me.

273
00:17:38,177 --> 00:17:40,969
That's $9.00 for two. 10 for 3.

274
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,543
That's 10 even, too.
That's a good product.

275
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:44,805
Ain't none of that alley shit.

276
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:46,723
People walking in front
of the camera waving,

277
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:48,994
Waving "hello."
Them Chinese made that shit.

278
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:50,746
No?

279
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:53,394
Much obliged.

280
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:55,193
It's a good deal. Good deal.

281
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:57,496
Hey, remember to holler
at my boy if you see him.

282
00:17:57,527 --> 00:17:58,666
All right.

283
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:00,321
All right. Here we go.

284
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:03,013
Bubbles depot
for my people.

285
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,093
Bubbles take care
of your troubles.

286
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,512
Ain't no trouble yet.

287
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:10,919
All right. All right. All right.

288
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,326
Take it easy, OK.

289
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,856
I know you remember me.

290
00:18:14,418 --> 00:18:16,327
All right. Be cool with it.
Be cool with it.

291
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,801
Give it up, nigger.

292
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:20,134
That's what I'm gonna say
to you every time we meet.

293
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:21,159
Money or pills.

294
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,478
Don't care which.

295
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,208
All right. All right. Cool.

296
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:26,868
I'm getting it.

297
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,639
See?

298
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:37,352
Back down, yo. He's in a hole.

299
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,045
Motherfucker bad for business, man.

300
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:54,267
You don't take care
your neighborhood store?

301
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:02,276
Officer?

302
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:07,559
Officer.

303
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,935
How you doing, officer.
Can you help me out please?

304
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:13,162
I just got robbed.

305
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:15,718
Thank you, man.
They all saw it.

306
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:17,979
Everybody was here
witnessing everything.

307
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:21,148
Took your money?

308
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:22,923
Yeah, man. Same guy
every day, you know.

309
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,480
He just went-- He went down the alley
towards Pacing street.

310
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:26,887
You cut him off on Lafayette--

311
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:29,265
You can't sell on the street
without a license.

312
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:33,769
And these movies--
it's copyright infringement.

313
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:35,456
Come on, man.

314
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:36,842
That's a hefty fine.

315
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:44,830
That's my 10--

316
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:48,455
Are you gonna rob me, too?

317
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:51,209
That's what you're gonna do?
You rob me also?

318
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:53,470
Baltimore's finest right here.
Thank you.

319
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:04,867
Everybody gather up.

320
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,273
All right?

321
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,097
Everybody take 5
and gather up.

322
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,949
Mike, get in here, too.

323
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:27,943
I want everybody that use
the gym to hear this now.

324
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,502
Most of y'all know I came home
after being in a long time.

325
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:39,254
And some of y'all--
shit.

326
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,006
All of y'all probably seen
me welcoming the attentions

327
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:44,554
of some of the ladies
who come past.

328
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:46,886
Easy.

329
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:53,069
Now, I realize that some
of these ladies is your relations.

330
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:58,026
I ain't mean to disrespect y'all
or have any feelings hurt.

331
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:02,687
All y'all come in here
to learn a sport

332
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,420
and better yourselves.

333
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:06,877
Ain't no need for me to get
in the way of that.

334
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:12,033
All right.

335
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:19,610
And if your witness
is in the game

336
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,006
and Omar jacked him up good--

337
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:23,308
- What the fuck is this?
- Hey, Crutch, I'm just asking.

338
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:24,740
That dick shop kin to you or what?

339
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:27,181
Hey, Vernon, man, you ran
the sheet on that old face, right?

340
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,913
Yeah. He was an asshole.
So what?

341
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:30,217
So what? What's the history?

342
00:21:30,236 --> 00:21:33,187
Motherfucker, do we come behind
your casework talking This kind of shit?

343
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:34,713
- Do we?
- Come on.

344
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,260
No.
Fuck you, Bunk.

345
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:38,826
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

346
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:56,003
Soon as he comes out the gym,
yo, bank his ass, man.

347
00:21:56,436 --> 00:21:57,701
Make sure that
nigger's shook.

348
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:02,910
You thought I
wouldn't handle it.

349
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,636
You need some proof.

350
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,189
I don't know about
all this beefin', man.

351
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,647
What, you scared, nigger?

352
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:13,761
We need to pump
your ass up some more.

353
00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:28,173
Game on.

354
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:38,773
You coming round
the way tomorrow?

355
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:40,827
I think you should
stay off that spot.

356
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:42,349
Bitch, I'm talking to you!

357
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:44,519
Man, fuck you.
Fuck!

358
00:22:49,706 --> 00:22:51,593
Fists don't work
for you, nigger.

359
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:58,175
Y'all got to take this shit
out of front of my door.

360
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:05,495
Naman, go inside.

361
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,839
Man, fuck you.

362
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,715
Hey, I feel you, man.

363
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,181
Ain't no beef here though.

364
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:12,514
All right?

365
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:17,897
Go inside, man.

366
00:23:24,294 --> 00:23:25,785
Yo, what happened to your boy?

367
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:28,779
- Fuck happened to you?
- Ain't nothing.

368
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:30,590
You need to see how
the other nigger look.

369
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:31,666
Who is that?

370
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,315
Ain't nothing.
I can handle that fool.

371
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,579
You ain't have to step, too.

372
00:23:34,635 --> 00:23:37,013
Oh, shit, no.
You had everything under control.

373
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,131
Look at your face.

374
00:23:38,288 --> 00:23:41,214
Course, I recognize the other
boy was high as all hell.

375
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,680
And anything can jump off
when it's like that, you know.

376
00:23:43,747 --> 00:23:46,391
Yeah, and he'd have been on
his ass if you ain't mixed in.

377
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:56,084
What's going on?

378
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:57,627
He into something?

379
00:23:58,363 --> 00:23:59,703
Ain't none of my business.

380
00:24:00,342 --> 00:24:01,569
Yours either.

381
00:24:07,434 --> 00:24:11,178
Seriously, you guys
ran a hell of a campaign.

382
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:12,656
No let-up. Lot of heart.

383
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,787
- I'll second that.
- Yeah. I liked to shit

384
00:24:14,843 --> 00:24:17,307
when you trotted out
that witness story during the debate.

385
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,379
What about the fucking
last-Minute fliers

386
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:20,530
and me and the Slum Lord

387
00:24:20,568 --> 00:24:22,312
doing a tango
on the courthouse steps?

388
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:23,686
Wait.

389
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:25,910
Parker, who was behind that?

390
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:27,857
I didn't see no Royce authority line.

391
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:28,952
Well?

392
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,468
Tommy, enough of the bullshit. Hmm?

393
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:39,778
What the hell are we waiting for?

394
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,859
Bring your ass around here
and try out the big chair.

395
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:43,903
Come on.

396
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,661
Come on around here.
I'm not even mayor-elect.

397
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:49,611
General election's
still a few weeks away.

398
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:52,796
You don't beat Crawford
in a city where we outnumber

399
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:56,244
republicans 9:1,
you don't deserve the fucking job.

400
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:57,735
Now, get on around here.

401
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,828
If I lose the general election,
I'll just blame Norman here.

402
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:06,096
He's taking over
from Terri D'Agostino.

403
00:25:06,341 --> 00:25:07,662
She did good for you.

404
00:25:08,288 --> 00:25:09,779
Yeah, she did.
The national noticed.

405
00:25:09,826 --> 00:25:12,604
She's back a D triple C looking
to target red-state delegations.

406
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:14,909
After what she pulled off,
I hope she got a win bonus.

407
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:15,965
Hell, yeah.

408
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:17,391
They gave her my share, too.

409
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:18,693
Wouldn't you know it?

410
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:22,776
Tommy, whatever you need
going forward,

411
00:25:23,593 --> 00:25:25,442
For the general election,
for the transition--

412
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,801
I want to hit the ground running,

413
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,477
so I'm gonna need
to learn the agencies,

414
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:31,214
the budgets, the problems, all of it.

415
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:34,176
Wherever you want to go,
whatever you want to look at. See to it.

416
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:36,748
It's a hell of a goddamn job.

417
00:25:37,428 --> 00:25:38,843
Halfway glad to get out.

418
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,488
I'm gonna miss it.

419
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:02,708
Braddock case running you in circles?

420
00:26:04,008 --> 00:26:05,808
Whole day was a waste of time.

421
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,038
Why not talk to Wardell himself?

422
00:26:13,226 --> 00:26:15,623
Ask him if he killed
the witness against him.

423
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,540
If he read the newspapers,
he already knows he's a suspect.

424
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:23,039
Will he take a polygraph?
Call his lawyer.

425
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:26,122
Tell him they're about to shift the
narcotics case off to the federal court

426
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,172
because a state
witness was murdered.

427
00:26:28,982 --> 00:26:31,321
Tell him if his client
doesn't cooperate,

428
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:34,353
he's looking at mandatory
minimums and no parole.

429
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,980
The feds don't want
drug cases anymore,

430
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:40,417
especially not a case that's gonna
fall apart without a key witness.

431
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,549
Bluff.

432
00:26:42,094 --> 00:26:43,697
What have you got to lose?

433
00:26:43,824 --> 00:26:46,182
Maybe he blows the box.
Maybe he passes.

434
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:49,466
But he talks a bit either way,

435
00:26:50,449 --> 00:26:53,110
And you, detective,
get to listen.

436
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:57,054
The fuck am I looking at here?

437
00:26:59,946 --> 00:27:02,372
Birds, I think.

438
00:27:02,763 --> 00:27:05,443
You see that there?
I think that's a wing flapping.

439
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:22,847
Shit. Fuck!

440
00:27:32,403 --> 00:27:33,931
Fuck it anyway, man.

441
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:38,153
Mr. Bond?

442
00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:40,309
Hey. Call me Rupert.

443
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,003
Thanks for coming over.

444
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:43,697
Try to get a running start.

445
00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:46,078
- Meeting with my unit chiefs.
- No problem.

446
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,170
Congratulations on
the election result.

447
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:51,970
You'll be coming in
with quite a mandate.

448
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,165
Maybe so.

449
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:57,636
So, how can I help you
with the transition?

450
00:27:58,383 --> 00:28:00,636
There's not a lot of
high-end narcotics cases

451
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:02,482
In the pipeline.
And major crimes--

452
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,615
We'll cut it
for political reasons.

453
00:28:04,705 --> 00:28:06,627
Once the polls put me
up there with Demper,

454
00:28:06,796 --> 00:28:08,603
people started whispering in my ear.

455
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:11,677
And I also heard
about your subpoenas.

456
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:14,010
Andy Crotchick,
Clay Davis.

457
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:16,001
Sir, I didn't intend--

458
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,402
to go after a couple
of Royce's money men 4 weeks

459
00:28:18,469 --> 00:28:19,994
before a primary election?

460
00:28:21,195 --> 00:28:23,252
Yeah. I think
you're wasted in narcotics.

461
00:28:25,748 --> 00:28:26,805
Let me guess.

462
00:28:26,841 --> 00:28:28,916
How about V.C.U.
As unit chief?

463
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:33,464
- What?
- Violent Crimes Unit.

464
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:35,655
How about you take
that over for me?

465
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:38,968
Karkenny ran on a platform
of dropping the murder rate,

466
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:42,301
So V.C.U. Is where the sparks
are gonna fly, right?

467
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:46,226
You're putting me in charge
of all homicide prosecutions?

468
00:28:49,631 --> 00:28:51,000
What about Eileen Nathan?

469
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:52,829
She's moving up
to second deputy.

470
00:28:57,735 --> 00:29:01,000
I came in here ready to get
bounced down to misdemeanors or worse.

471
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:02,503
Why would you think that?

472
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:06,234
The subpoenas
and the fact that Demper--

473
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:07,653
Demper lost the election.

474
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:09,724
I won.

475
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:13,107
And I admire your courage
if not your loyalty.

476
00:29:14,806 --> 00:29:15,919
Lester.

477
00:29:16,274 --> 00:29:17,500
Excuse me?

478
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:19,773
Forgive me.

479
00:29:20,904 --> 00:29:22,667
V.C.U. is great.

480
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,966
I'm more than ready to work
murders for you, Mr. Bunt.

481
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,128
Good.

482
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:29,339
Rupert.

483
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:35,171
But now she's told police sex was
consensual on Paul and Monell only.

484
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:37,733
- So--
- So, Randy--

485
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,065
He'll be back tomorrow.

486
00:29:39,132 --> 00:29:40,434
And the thing with the police?

487
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,965
It's out of my hands

488
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,592
Turn it down, ladies.

489
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:47,505
Quenice, lose the gum.

490
00:29:51,484 --> 00:29:52,786
OK. Settle down.

491
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:54,186
Mr. Pryzbo!

492
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:56,132
What Nicky doing
with a computer?

493
00:29:56,402 --> 00:29:59,099
We're gonna have a computer in the class
for a special project.

494
00:29:59,835 --> 00:30:02,270
- And another thing--
- Dang. They all new and shit.

495
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:04,925
Leave the old ones on your desks.

496
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,331
And put your names on the box

497
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:09,317
on the inside cover
of the new ones.

498
00:30:09,635 --> 00:30:12,069
OK. Did anyone have any
trouble with the homework?

499
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:14,924
Charlene?

500
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:16,104
I didn't get it.

501
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,217
Didn't get what?

502
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:18,273
None of it.

503
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:23,117
Michael?

504
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:31,666
That's great.
Good job.

505
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,837
Calvin, is this your work?

506
00:30:38,874 --> 00:30:40,395
'Cause it looks
like someone else's.

507
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:41,556
No. I do my work.

508
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:46,130
OK. Next time, try to remember
not to copy Quenice's name at the top.

509
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,096
All right. Did everybody
get a new textbook?

510
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:53,673
Great. OK.

511
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:56,712
Well, for now at least,
you can get those out of sight.

512
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:01,436
Naman, why aren't
you in uniform?

513
00:31:04,003 --> 00:31:05,682
Why did you decide
not to wear it?

514
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:09,328
I ain't in my right class,
so ain't no need for a uniform.

515
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:10,519
Interesting.

516
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:13,628
Why you always write down
everything we say?

517
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:16,001
Trying to get inside
our heads or something?

518
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:17,707
You trying to get into mine?

519
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:21,837
Chandra, do you think this is
a beauty salon or a classroom?

520
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:26,861
Darnell, why didn't
you wear your uniform?

521
00:31:27,478 --> 00:31:30,028
I meant to. I did.

522
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:31,838
Yeah, but after, like,
a quart of vodka,

523
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:34,639
It be hard and all what color shirt
you supposed to be wearing.

524
00:31:35,748 --> 00:31:37,596
And you find that funny, Naman.

525
00:31:37,882 --> 00:31:39,014
Man, fuck you.

526
00:31:40,195 --> 00:31:41,850
Darnell has a drinking problem,

527
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:45,045
and Naman, we believe,
suffers from conduct-disorder issues.

528
00:31:45,102 --> 00:31:46,102
Fuck you.

529
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:47,694
Yeah. He's got a mouth on him. Yeah.

530
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:50,585
Chandra, is it necessary
to comb your hair in class?

531
00:31:50,623 --> 00:31:52,227
Fuck you, cheese-face bitch!

532
00:31:52,294 --> 00:31:53,410
Chandra, I should tell you--

533
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:55,043
You ain't tellin' nobody nothing.

534
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,658
You know, I was wondering
why she was in the class.

535
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,414
- She seemed so--
- Chandra, listen to me.

536
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:00,893
Oppositional defiant personality.

537
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,460
Get the fuck out of my face, bitch.

538
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:04,193
I'm sorry you're
having a bad day,

539
00:32:04,492 --> 00:32:07,379
But you're gonna have to take
a little walk with Miss Mason.

540
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,259
Come back when you've pulled
it all back together again.

541
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:12,978
Yeah. It's bye-Bye time
for my girl Chandra.

542
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:14,715
Yeah. You think?

543
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:20,293
Then to reiterate,
this is a polygraph examination,

544
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,992
Non-admissible,
and the answers to all questions

545
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:26,493
are regarded as a proffer
with a limited grant of immunity.

546
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:27,759
Agreed.

547
00:32:27,797 --> 00:32:30,778
OK. To begin, please answer yes
to a series of questions

548
00:32:31,136 --> 00:32:33,404
Regardless of whether or
not that answer is correct.

549
00:32:34,617 --> 00:32:36,025
Is your name Anthony Wardell?

550
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:37,652
Yeah.

551
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:39,180
And you're from
Baltimore, Maryland?

552
00:32:39,236 --> 00:32:41,722
Right now I'm over at city
jail, but I'm from east side.

553
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,891
So your answer is?

554
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,559
Yeah, I'm from Baltimore.

555
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:45,858
Are you female?

556
00:32:45,974 --> 00:32:47,087
Fuck is wrong with--

557
00:32:48,597 --> 00:32:49,691
My bad.

558
00:32:49,877 --> 00:32:51,745
Yeah, I'm a bitch.

559
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:59,860
- Hey, sweet thing.
- Chandra.

560
00:33:01,332 --> 00:33:02,973
We're working on our short essay.

561
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,191
- If you--
- Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

562
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:07,757
Need to get down to lay down.

563
00:33:07,832 --> 00:33:11,189
Naman, if you don't stop, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave class.

564
00:33:12,342 --> 00:33:14,640
See you sad-ass
motherfuckers in about 3 days.

565
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:16,454
You're leaving class, not school.

566
00:33:21,357 --> 00:33:23,256
What about now, bitch? Huh?

567
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:26,689
That's not necessary, Naman.

568
00:33:27,182 --> 00:33:28,390
Oh, you gonna suspend me?

569
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:30,128
We're gonna have a little talk.

570
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,151
Man, fuck y'all.

571
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,340
I know the rules.

572
00:33:33,407 --> 00:33:36,294
You gotta suspend me.
School gotta have rules.

573
00:33:37,022 --> 00:33:38,343
He right.
You gotta have rules.

574
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,654
Throw that shit out.

575
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,557
The point is
I can call it like you want.

576
00:33:41,966 --> 00:33:43,640
You want him to pass?
He passed.

577
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:46,335
You want him to come up inconclusive,
He's inconclusive.

578
00:33:46,448 --> 00:33:48,335
The fuck kind
of science is that?

579
00:33:48,656 --> 00:33:50,505
Come on.
Did he blow the box or not?

580
00:33:50,622 --> 00:33:52,103
I'm here for you, detective.

581
00:33:54,715 --> 00:33:56,422
You know what we use
the polygraph for?

582
00:33:56,489 --> 00:33:57,489
Leverage.

583
00:33:57,921 --> 00:33:59,864
To get him in here
and fuck with him.

584
00:34:02,452 --> 00:34:04,471
No wonder this shit's inadmissible.

585
00:34:11,611 --> 00:34:12,630
Let me guess.

586
00:34:12,913 --> 00:34:15,254
They're out in the hall
and Stotowski is telling them

587
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:17,084
that he can make it go
any way they want.

588
00:34:17,254 --> 00:34:19,936
If you think that's how we play
it, then why let your client--

589
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,955
Because you know there's not much case
left now that your witness is dead.

590
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:27,521
I don't need to expose him
to a federal charge If I can avoid it.

591
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,370
And because
even if Stotowski bends it for our ears,

592
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:35,941
He's let you know that Mr. Wardell here
did not blow the box.

593
00:34:36,614 --> 00:34:38,029
Yo, I wouldn't kill me.

594
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,180
Even if it flips on me,
I ain't gonna do shit to the man.

595
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:42,454
Why not?

596
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,654
My moms and his--
they're, like, cousins.

597
00:34:44,862 --> 00:34:46,768
Came up together
in the Latrope, you know.

598
00:34:46,938 --> 00:34:50,193
I've been knowing him since,
like, head start and shit.

599
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,769
But he was gonna testify.

600
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:54,675
What I'm looking at on the first
conviction on this kind of wave?

601
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:57,985
7, 8? Shit.
I'll be out in 31/2.

602
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,786
You think I'm gonna kill
my mom's cousin's boy for 31/2?

603
00:35:02,807 --> 00:35:05,186
I know that man helped get
himself elected claiming that

604
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:07,190
I did me like that,
but please.

605
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:14,330
Bum-ass motherfucker
was gonna testify against me,

606
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:16,877
and I swear to God
I feel bad he's dead.

607
00:35:18,126 --> 00:35:19,144
I do.

608
00:35:20,381 --> 00:35:21,781
Hey, Eileen,

609
00:35:22,951 --> 00:35:24,668
been looking all over for you.

610
00:35:27,996 --> 00:35:29,147
Omar Little.

611
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,344
From bird's trial
a couple years ago.

612
00:35:31,514 --> 00:35:32,530
The stickup boy.

613
00:35:33,671 --> 00:35:35,595
He's in city jail on felony murder.

614
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,030
Store robbery west side.

615
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:39,219
When I gave him the card,

616
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:41,243
I told him it was for a light
felony at best.

617
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:43,009
Yeah, of course, but...

618
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:45,418
he needs to get right out of BCDC

619
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:48,117
and put in protective
custody somewhere else.

620
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,617
I'm sharing his address
with about 800 other guys

621
00:35:50,684 --> 00:35:52,651
who have seen the business end
of his shotgun.

622
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:53,777
Why do you care?

623
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,877
I'm pretty sure
that he's being set up on this one.

624
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:58,918
Really? How does that play with
the rest of the guys in the squad room?

625
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,668
Look, all I'm asking
is that you move him

626
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:02,508
to some county detention center

627
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:05,217
at least until I have a chance
to work back up on this thing.

628
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:08,768
Now, this card
ought to buy him that much.

629
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:14,616
Is Hartford county
detention center quiet enough?

630
00:36:15,747 --> 00:36:17,351
Go pick up a writ in my office

631
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:20,068
and tell Mr. Little my debt's paid.

632
00:36:21,308 --> 00:36:25,242
The fact is that homicides are off
14% in the West for this year.

633
00:36:26,324 --> 00:36:28,477
But I'm not gonna stand here
and take credit for that

634
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:30,253
when all other UCR
felonies are up.

635
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,540
Why not, Major?

636
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,550
A Wise man once told me years ago
when I wasn't even a Sergeant

637
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,323
that you should never take
credit when the crime rate drops

638
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:40,056
unless you want to take
the blame when it rises.

639
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:44,454
Atten-Hut.

640
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:46,046
Mayor-elect is on deck.

641
00:36:46,106 --> 00:36:47,582
Please,
back to what you're doing.

642
00:36:47,649 --> 00:36:49,649
I'm just a councilman
here to observe.

643
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:51,121
At ease, gentlemen.

644
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:54,549
Major Daniels,
continue your presentation.

645
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:57,981
In any event, rather than
allow my post cars to patrol

646
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:00,248
the grand deputy,
I put two-man cars in the post

647
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:01,748
with the worst drug corners:

648
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:06,548
Edmonson avenue, Poplar grove,
Fayette and Baltimore streets,

649
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:08,732
North avenue.

650
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:13,381
Now, if nothing else,
a two-Man car is more aggressive,

651
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,715
and that helps push it away
from the most volatile corners,

652
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:18,097
which may be having an effect.

653
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:19,387
Just pushing it?

654
00:37:19,556 --> 00:37:22,645
I'm not devoting my resources
to cheap street arrests, commissioner.

655
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:26,002
Instead, I'm trying to bring
every officer I can to bear

656
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:27,979
on making quality felony cases.

657
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:31,023
I could do more, but,
well, it's my opinion that not

658
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:33,184
enough of the troops I have
are sufficiently trained

659
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:35,136
to properly investigate such cases.

660
00:37:35,484 --> 00:37:38,146
Major, you just insulted your command.

661
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,085
Respectfully, sir,

662
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,181
too many of my people have spent years

663
00:37:42,238 --> 00:37:43,765
chasing street-Level arrests

664
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:45,425
while they grab bodies
and make stats.

665
00:37:45,492 --> 00:37:47,805
But that doesn't teach you
how to write a proper warrant

666
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:50,013
or testify properly
as to probable cause

667
00:37:50,313 --> 00:37:52,546
or use and not get used
by an informant.

668
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,312
I wish it were otherwise.

669
00:37:54,737 --> 00:37:56,475
But if I'm chasing
felony cases,

670
00:37:56,532 --> 00:37:58,845
I can only bring a minority
of my officers to bear.

671
00:37:59,037 --> 00:38:00,145
You got all of it already.

672
00:38:00,212 --> 00:38:01,145
That's right.

673
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,312
Make a nigger work.

674
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:03,379
You like that shit.

675
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:05,014
Ain't that right,
motherfucker?

676
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,445
You can't hide, son.

677
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,512
Don't care where it is.

678
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:13,251
In a nigger's ass crack,
I'll still find you.

679
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,044
Damn. Fucked that man up.

680
00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:29,478
Yeah, boy.

681
00:38:29,762 --> 00:38:30,821
All right.

682
00:38:31,085 --> 00:38:32,981
So we starting a little
later than I wanted.

683
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:35,844
Yo, but you said you was gonna
peep out of school after lunch.

684
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:37,611
I tried. They won't put me out.

685
00:38:37,762 --> 00:38:40,244
- Shit. Ain't no school
gonna hold me if I want to go.

686
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,110
It's this new class they put me in.

687
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:45,510
It's so fucked up, yo,
they working all backwards and shit.

688
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,441
All right. Let's get to this.

689
00:38:47,553 --> 00:38:49,157
Yo, Bobby.
You working the stash.

690
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:51,477
Yo, yo, why aren't where
we was yesterday?

691
00:38:51,544 --> 00:38:52,477
The spot was right.

692
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:53,677
This is good here?

693
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:54,910
Fuck is wrong with you?

694
00:38:55,408 --> 00:38:57,010
He was on the strip yesterday.

695
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:58,464
This ain't shit.

696
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:02,043
Yo, if you don't want to sell
my shit, then fuck you, Kinnard.

697
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:03,711
I keep my money.

698
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:05,677
This spot just as good as the other.

699
00:39:05,985 --> 00:39:07,155
Shit...

700
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,643
Do you know how much
that video camera cost?

701
00:39:13,014 --> 00:39:16,919
4,200, which makes our
adventure with fuzzy Dunlop

702
00:39:17,014 --> 00:39:18,841
Look like a fucking
walk in the park.

703
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:20,464
To get the camera
from I.S.D.,

704
00:39:20,516 --> 00:39:22,987
I had to get authorization
from your supervisor, right?

705
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:29,259
Still, you lost it doing police work.
Your Lieutenant will understand.

706
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:30,316
Mello?

707
00:39:30,372 --> 00:39:32,262
You know what that
asshole understands?

708
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:34,994
Burning motherfuckers
for petty shit like this.

709
00:39:35,361 --> 00:39:37,175
- Help me, Carv.
- This is not my problem.

710
00:39:37,394 --> 00:39:38,642
Don't fuck me, Carv.

711
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:40,122
Don't fuck me now.

712
00:39:41,072 --> 00:39:42,362
You know what this is?

713
00:39:42,664 --> 00:39:44,642
This is one of those
enabling relationships.

714
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,041
Enable me, Carv.

715
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:49,866
Enable me--
to find my fucking camera.

716
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:56,637
- You're seeing pigeons?
- Last night we did.

717
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,307
Me and Sander ran the west side

718
00:39:58,374 --> 00:40:00,274
looking at every pigeon
coop we could find.

719
00:40:00,538 --> 00:40:03,542
This morning,
nothing in the monitor.

720
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:04,973
You check the pawn shops?

721
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,081
Every one.

722
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,533
I fucking know
this asshole Marlow has my camera.

723
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:09,897
Oh, fuck me.

724
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,581
- What?
- You just reminded me.

725
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:15,301
I had to brief this kid
last week who said he knew

726
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:17,474
something about a murder
that Marlow's people did.

727
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:18,736
I meant to call Bunk on it.

728
00:40:18,812 --> 00:40:19,891
Bunk caught the case?

729
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:22,839
No. Actually, he had a warrant for
the guy who supposedly got killed.

730
00:40:23,175 --> 00:40:25,401
I rode around with him
on it a while back.

731
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:27,839
What about me?

732
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,906
I got problems here, man.

733
00:40:31,914 --> 00:40:35,406
The only thing you can do is get some
wood on Marlow Stanfield or his people.

734
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:37,976
Scare him enough to
send the camera back.

735
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:39,906
What do you have on Marlow?

736
00:40:40,173 --> 00:40:41,506
I know he's a drug dealer.

737
00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:43,473
I can't prove it or nothing, but I know.

738
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,370
<i>Detective Pitts,</i>
<i>pick up 2594. Pitts...</i>

739
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,031
OK, listen.

740
00:40:48,415 --> 00:40:50,505
How about I let you
debrief the kid first?

741
00:40:50,572 --> 00:40:51,644
See what he can give you.

742
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,864
This gets the camera home?

743
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,621
Maybe not, but you talk to the runt,

744
00:40:54,696 --> 00:40:56,586
and maybe he gives
you some shit on Marlow.

745
00:40:56,661 --> 00:40:59,681
Maybe even gives you a murder or two.
and before you call homicide on it,

746
00:40:59,704 --> 00:41:01,137
you walk it back to Mello

747
00:41:01,187 --> 00:41:03,206
like the cat with
the mouse in its teeth.

748
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:06,178
You bring him the murder,
he probably forgives the camera.

749
00:41:06,806 --> 00:41:08,372
<i>Loomin, line 5.</i>

750
00:41:08,821 --> 00:41:10,371
<i>Loomin, pick up</i>
<i>the fucking phone.</i>

751
00:41:13,616 --> 00:41:15,213
Looking for
detective Moreland?

752
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,852
Could you have him call Sergeant
Carver at the western, please?

753
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:22,301
Carver?
Western?

754
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:23,737
Wait a minute.

755
00:41:24,752 --> 00:41:25,762
Got it.

756
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:36,738
Fuck that Bunk.

757
00:41:40,006 --> 00:41:41,003
Thoughts on your cabinet?

758
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:42,255
Lots of them.

759
00:41:42,403 --> 00:41:45,136
But top of the list,
Irvin Burrell's ass is gone.

760
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:48,403
I told Royce to dump
him more than a year ago.

761
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:52,670
But Clarence didn't want to piss off
the ministers until after the primary.

762
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,603
Primary's over.
He can do it now.

763
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,968
You think Clarence Royce
is gonna do you that favor?

764
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:59,192
He's already thinking
about taking a poke at Elisha

765
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:01,636
and running for the seventh
district congressional seat.

766
00:42:01,931 --> 00:42:05,002
He's gonna need every black minister
in town to lay hands upon him.

767
00:42:05,114 --> 00:42:06,100
Fine. I'll do it myself.

768
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:07,202
No, you won't.

769
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,211
Royce can fire a black
police commissioner,

770
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:11,535
but the newly elected
white mayor cannot.

771
00:42:11,617 --> 00:42:14,002
Same brothers who voted
for you be at your throat.

772
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:16,802
What if I got a black commissioner
to replace the son of a bitch?

773
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:19,069
Under Burrell, the only
black deputy is Cawthorne,

774
00:42:19,295 --> 00:42:20,536
And he's 70.

775
00:42:20,716 --> 00:42:22,803
After that, it's just
Majors and Lieutenants.

776
00:42:22,922 --> 00:42:25,458
We go outside.
Nationwide search.

777
00:42:25,573 --> 00:42:27,134
Deputy chiefs in New York or L.A.

778
00:42:27,158 --> 00:42:29,058
make more than their
police commissioner.

779
00:42:29,527 --> 00:42:32,234
If you're talented and black,
why would you be in Baltimore?

780
00:42:32,445 --> 00:42:34,961
I have often asked
myself that very question

781
00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:36,513
on a number of occasions.

782
00:42:38,696 --> 00:42:40,728
So I'm stuck with Burrell.
Fuck.

783
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:46,484
Have a seat.

784
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:49,208
Don't keep him late.

785
00:42:49,243 --> 00:42:50,932
He's gotta be at school
in the morning.

786
00:42:51,049 --> 00:42:52,380
Did he say he was suspended?

787
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:53,872
They're letting me back in tomorrow.

788
00:42:53,895 --> 00:42:55,767
Miss Ander want me
to be home by 9:00.

789
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,479
And don't forget to send him
on to Bunk after you're done.

790
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:00,302
Look after him.
He's a good kid.

791
00:43:05,527 --> 00:43:06,600
You hungry?

792
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,005
Yeah.

793
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:10,543
Let's eat.

794
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:16,300
Hey, kid,
let me ask you right off the Bat.

795
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:20,739
You know what a police
surveillance camera looks like?

796
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:23,971
Councilman, you sure you don't
want to ride with Lieutenant Grace?

797
00:43:24,054 --> 00:43:25,766
I mean, she'll be in
command of the ship.

798
00:43:25,832 --> 00:43:27,965
What's the point of
a ride-along with bosses?

799
00:43:28,285 --> 00:43:29,956
I need to see what
the troops see, right?

800
00:43:29,995 --> 00:43:32,724
Fine. I love the idea of a mayor
who knows what we're up against.

801
00:43:32,934 --> 00:43:34,357
Officers McFarley
and Ginter,

802
00:43:34,614 --> 00:43:37,492
This is the mayor-elect, and
he'll be riding with you in sector 3.

803
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:39,054
- How you doing?
- Hey.

804
00:43:39,105 --> 00:43:40,449
Don't let him get captured.

805
00:43:42,135 --> 00:43:44,495
Obviously I didn't know
nothing about it in the beginning.

806
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:45,505
Little Kevin--

807
00:43:45,528 --> 00:43:48,558
he just told me to tell Lex
to go to the playground behind Fulton.

808
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:50,041
'Cause his girl was up there.

809
00:43:50,354 --> 00:43:51,658
And Lex got killed?

810
00:43:52,681 --> 00:43:54,524
- Yeah.
- When did he get killed?

811
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,098
So you actually weren't
there to see him killed?

812
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:01,360
I told you. Little Kevin--
he just told me to tell Lex

813
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,964
to go up to the playground
and see this girl Patrice.

814
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:06,231
Then later, Kevin come up
to me and tell me

815
00:44:06,504 --> 00:44:07,997
Chris and Snoop killed the dude.

816
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:09,431
What's Kevin's last name?

817
00:44:09,698 --> 00:44:11,690
- I don't know.
- You don't have his name?

818
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,290
Little Kevin all I know.

819
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:14,713
So let me get this straight.

820
00:44:14,796 --> 00:44:16,264
He told the guy
to go somewhere,

821
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:19,509
and then you heard he was killed,
but you don't know where he was killed,

822
00:44:19,568 --> 00:44:21,764
and you don't even know
if anyone ever found the body?

823
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,093
How do you Lex is really dead?

824
00:44:23,132 --> 00:44:24,164
Everybody know it.

825
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,631
- Who is everybody?
- Everybody from around the way.

826
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:30,213
Yo, listen. People be saying that Chris
and Snoop be turning niggers

827
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,647
into zombies for Marlow,

828
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:33,196
but I know that ain't true.

829
00:44:33,263 --> 00:44:35,096
When you dead,
you dead as all.

830
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:36,563
Zombies, huh?

831
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:37,962
You know what this is?

832
00:44:38,857 --> 00:44:40,063
This is bullshit.

833
00:44:40,558 --> 00:44:42,232
- You're bullshitting me.
- No, sir.

834
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:45,430
You were right there when this
Lex fellow got dropped, Weren't you?

835
00:44:45,496 --> 00:44:46,829
- No.
- Yes, you were.

836
00:44:46,896 --> 00:44:49,663
You're an eyeball witness who
can get me Snoop and Chris both.

837
00:44:49,822 --> 00:44:50,962
- I told you--
- Look, kid.

838
00:44:51,029 --> 00:44:52,829
If you were there, you can say so.

839
00:44:52,894 --> 00:44:54,080
We can do a lot for you.

840
00:44:54,139 --> 00:44:56,512
Maybe help you out with this
problem you got at the school.

841
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:58,588
I ain't got a problem no more.
I'm good with that.

842
00:44:58,607 --> 00:45:00,316
- Come on. You were there, right?
- Herc.

843
00:45:00,356 --> 00:45:01,779
Just say you were there!

844
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:04,162
So how do you like being mayor so far?

845
00:45:04,393 --> 00:45:06,300
I still gotta win
the general election in May.

846
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,079
Inauguration's not till December.

847
00:45:08,893 --> 00:45:10,020
So what do I know?

848
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:11,861
Well, you can't do
any worse than Royce.

849
00:45:11,928 --> 00:45:13,262
City's going to shit.

850
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,817
Yeah. Well,

851
00:45:16,122 --> 00:45:18,009
what do you guys suggest I do first?

852
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:20,133
An air strike.

853
00:45:20,663 --> 00:45:21,928
White phosphorus.

854
00:45:22,114 --> 00:45:24,721
Drop that shit on everything
between here and north avenue.

855
00:45:25,195 --> 00:45:26,931
Seriously. That shit works.

856
00:45:27,094 --> 00:45:28,365
My brother's a marine, right?

857
00:45:28,444 --> 00:45:30,322
They use W.P. over there in Fallujah.

858
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,394
<i>Signal 13,</i>
<i>shots fired 200 north Calhoun.</i>

859
00:45:33,594 --> 00:45:34,695
Bang. There it is.

860
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:36,628
Now you're gonna see
some shit, Mr. Mayor.

861
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:37,790
Pardon my French.

862
00:45:42,669 --> 00:45:44,013
You know what's fucked up?

863
00:45:44,724 --> 00:45:46,170
No one hears the gunshot.

864
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:50,534
On the canvas, no one even
claims to hear the shot.

865
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,560
So, look. Our next move is to
work back on Wardell's visiting list.

866
00:45:59,605 --> 00:46:01,780
If the Sergeant asks,
I'm on the street.

867
00:46:08,543 --> 00:46:10,500
Fuck is that,
13 on Calhoun street?

868
00:46:10,638 --> 00:46:13,505
I don't know, but they 1032'ed
10 minutes ago, sir.

869
00:46:13,762 --> 00:46:16,149
You're not dropping me
off at my crib, are you?

870
00:46:16,505 --> 00:46:19,446
I mean, you can leave me, like,
a block or two off from here.

871
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,988
I can walk
the rest of the way.

872
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:23,025
Don't want to be seen
with the police, huh?

873
00:46:24,226 --> 00:46:25,289
Yeah.

874
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:26,594
All right, boss.

875
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:27,899
Pull over right here.

876
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:41,692
Fuck was Carv thinking?

877
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:43,325
This kid can't give me a murder.

878
00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:45,953
We go right at Marlow.

879
00:46:46,327 --> 00:46:49,351
Fuck the back door when we
can go in the front, you know.

880
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:53,024
Next I want a detective at university

881
00:46:53,091 --> 00:46:55,554
in case the guy that comes out
makes any kind of declaration.

882
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:57,531
Right, and have someone
in the room with him.

883
00:46:57,571 --> 00:47:00,026
Officer Leach has been transported
down to you by a Sergeant.

884
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:01,766
Service weapon's with
detective Hollister,

885
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:02,893
On the way to ballistics.

886
00:47:03,703 --> 00:47:05,582
No. No.
Looks like a clean shoot.

887
00:47:05,642 --> 00:47:07,556
I've got spent shells
from two suspect weapons.

888
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,324
Different calibers.
Both recovered.

889
00:47:09,658 --> 00:47:11,101
Right. Yeah. I know.

890
00:47:11,899 --> 00:47:13,856
No. I'm not out here at the scene.

891
00:47:14,246 --> 00:47:17,508
But call the P.I.O. and have him
issue a statement from downtown.

892
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:20,012
Tell the S.A.O. that if they
want to have someone out here

893
00:47:20,051 --> 00:47:22,443
to survey the scene, they need
to move now 'cause crime lab

894
00:47:22,483 --> 00:47:24,776
is finishing up, and the
O.C.M.E. van is here waiting.

895
00:47:24,879 --> 00:47:26,381
Yeah. I'll get him call me.

896
00:47:26,688 --> 00:47:28,536
Isn't that the Destern
District Commander?

897
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,790
Yeah. That's Daniels.

898
00:47:29,855 --> 00:47:31,389
He's the duty officer tonight.

899
00:47:31,939 --> 00:47:33,501
Seems to know his business.

900
00:47:34,073 --> 00:47:35,575
He ain't as bad as some.

901
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:08,568
Police.

902
00:50:18,442 --> 00:50:19,824
Baltimore police.

903
00:50:23,996 --> 00:50:28,516
OK. There's still 85 eligible from
September who need an October day.

904
00:50:28,896 --> 00:50:29,982
That'll work, ma'am.

905
00:50:30,105 --> 00:50:33,225
I'm counting on you fellows to get it
done before the end of the month.

906
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:34,982
I can keep you on salary till then.

907
00:50:35,683 --> 00:50:38,431
You know what?
This ain't for me.

908
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:41,701
Look. I thank you for
the opportunity, ma'am,

909
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,348
But it ain't so much
just to bring a man for a day or two.

910
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:48,182
I mean,

911
00:50:48,735 --> 00:50:51,624
if you had something where
I was working with these kids...

912
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,343
anyway, thanks again.

913
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:09,214
- David.
- Hey.

914
00:51:09,281 --> 00:51:10,782
Thought you was at Ida Wells.

915
00:51:10,846 --> 00:51:12,514
Language-Arts position
opened up here,

916
00:51:13,162 --> 00:51:14,467
So I came over last year.

917
00:51:15,732 --> 00:51:17,459
- Hey. What's up, coach?
- Hey.

918
00:51:18,697 --> 00:51:20,514
You come over for some
of your boys today?

919
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,664
Some kind of program?

920
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:24,405
Nah. Something else.
Didn't work out really.

921
00:51:29,624 --> 00:51:30,790
Be well.

922
00:51:41,854 --> 00:51:43,179
You mind if I give him a go?

923
00:51:43,246 --> 00:51:45,093
- Sure.
- Fuck you!

924
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:49,561
OK.

925
00:51:53,747 --> 00:51:55,212
But you still in this room.

926
00:51:55,598 --> 00:51:56,765
Fuck you!

927
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:05,074
You know you're not going back with
the others till you learn to behave.

928
00:52:05,153 --> 00:52:06,256
Fuck you.

929
00:52:06,295 --> 00:52:08,160
Look. Until you
show you can handle it,

930
00:52:08,298 --> 00:52:10,312
You're not going back
to your regular class.

931
00:52:10,624 --> 00:52:11,878
Fuck you.

932
00:52:12,626 --> 00:52:14,247
Look. And you damn
sure ain't going home

933
00:52:14,287 --> 00:52:16,185
'Cause there ain't no more
getting suspended.

934
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:21,442
Mr. Colver, sir?

935
00:52:23,656 --> 00:52:25,831
Fuck you.

936
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:32,277
'Cause I ain't feel like it. That's why.

937
00:52:32,476 --> 00:52:33,577
This is bullshit.

938
00:52:33,858 --> 00:52:35,910
And I ain't reading no
motherfucking book either.

939
00:52:35,977 --> 00:52:37,970
I don't even know nothing
about the damn book.

940
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:41,212
And you always getting
on my ass and shit about some book.

941
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:43,439
Fuck you,
you cheese-face bitch.

942
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,721
Albert,
Albert, settle down now.

943
00:52:47,252 --> 00:52:49,210
This gonna be harder
than we thought, man.

944
00:52:50,091 --> 00:52:51,198
It's fascinating, isn't it?

945
00:52:51,257 --> 00:52:52,503
All right. Class...

946
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:54,544
This ain't no different
than the other class.

947
00:52:54,568 --> 00:52:57,012
- Clinically speaking.
- Except your fat ass is up in here.

948
00:53:00,353 --> 00:53:01,909
Yo, your point's full.

949
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,710
I'm hot. Come and get it.

950
00:53:03,946 --> 00:53:05,677
All right. I'll cover that.

951
00:53:06,374 --> 00:53:08,074
- Me, too.
- I bet on my boy Randy?

952
00:53:08,114 --> 00:53:09,543
You about to get
your money taken.

953
00:53:09,732 --> 00:53:10,978
Come on. Bet.

954
00:53:12,895 --> 00:53:14,200
Thank you.

955
00:53:14,544 --> 00:53:15,612
Pay up, sucker.

956
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:17,442
Randy, what are you doing?

957
00:53:17,876 --> 00:53:20,248
Didn't we go over this?
How many ways can you make a four.

958
00:53:20,446 --> 00:53:21,946
Not enough for his black ass.

959
00:53:22,104 --> 00:53:23,310
Look who's talking.

960
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:27,776
Yo, he just come today, so he miss
the whole thing about the odds.

961
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:28,942
Right.

962
00:53:29,021 --> 00:53:30,089
Give me.

963
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:33,449
There's only 3 ways to make a four.

964
00:53:33,965 --> 00:53:34,941
And to make a seven--

965
00:53:35,008 --> 00:53:36,088
6.

966
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,142
That's good.

967
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:38,675
So what should have been your play?

968
00:53:38,873 --> 00:53:40,435
Should have bet against him.

969
00:53:41,163 --> 00:53:43,338
Good to have you
back, Mr. Wagstaff.

970
00:53:44,338 --> 00:53:45,603
Come on, roll 'em, man.

971
00:54:01,384 --> 00:54:04,316
Trick them into thinking
they aren't learning, and they do.

972
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:17,799
Been looking all over for you.

973
00:54:18,238 --> 00:54:19,404
You found me.

974
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:24,287
Look, I been thinking, Sharad...

975
00:54:25,644 --> 00:54:27,607
we're going about
our thing all wrong.

976
00:54:27,946 --> 00:54:29,939
You know, look.
I made the mistake.

977
00:54:30,408 --> 00:54:32,741
I thinking I knew you better
than you knew yourself.

978
00:54:38,717 --> 00:54:41,648
This corner-- This corner mess
will bring you down fast. You know.

979
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:43,439
I think you need to come home.

980
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,039
Right? You come by tonight,
and we work this shit out together.

981
00:54:47,105 --> 00:54:49,887
All right? I been thinking about it.
Step right now.

982
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:51,776
I don't get paid till 8:00.

983
00:54:53,738 --> 00:54:54,872
8:00, huh?

984
00:55:02,034 --> 00:55:03,160
You all right?

985
00:55:04,366 --> 00:55:06,146
Just a little tired.
That's all.

986
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:12,705
So I'm gonna see you tonight.
Right, Sharad?

987
00:55:37,247 --> 00:55:38,850
You want to help me
take a statement?

988
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,234
Braddock case is down.

989
00:55:41,788 --> 00:55:43,003
Room two.

990
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:50,860
You veteran crime fighters
got a name for this, right?

991
00:55:51,236 --> 00:55:53,169
Murder weapon or
some shit like that?

992
00:56:02,577 --> 00:56:03,803
No fucking way.

993
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,870
Slug from autopsy matches two more

994
00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:08,106
I pulled from
that smokehound's backyard.

995
00:56:08,504 --> 00:56:10,678
Block into the side alley
from where Braddock fell.

996
00:56:10,777 --> 00:56:12,418
Our guy's dead from a stray.

997
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:16,370
He was shooting at 40s and
Clorox bottles blocks away

998
00:56:16,601 --> 00:56:18,381
Using potatoes for a silencer.

999
00:56:18,668 --> 00:56:20,269
Bite me. That's ridiculous.

1000
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:24,304
So our guy's dead because
a bullet misses a bleach bottle.

1001
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:27,735
And this fuck Karkenny gets to
be the mayor behind the stupidity.

1002
00:56:28,165 --> 00:56:29,667
I fucking love this town.

1003
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:30,834
I do.

1004
00:56:33,372 --> 00:56:34,834
Nice pull, Greggs.

1005
00:56:36,044 --> 00:56:37,270
Soft eyes.

1006
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,350
Sharad!

1007
00:57:28,051 --> 00:57:31,698
