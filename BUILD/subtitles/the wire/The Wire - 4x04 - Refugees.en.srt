1
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:23,809
You been nipping
at me all night, son.

2
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,632
Thing I got to figure is,

3
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:28,212
is you ready to bite the whole ass.

4
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:30,149
Ain't me with
a mountain by my elbow.

5
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,711
Oh, so you doing all right.

6
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:35,643
You like the town car?

7
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,698
You young'uns,

8
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:42,549

9
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:46,698
fucking u-ray or some shit,
I don't know.

10
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:47,942
See, but me?

11
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:49,651
I like me a town car.

12
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,633
Man look quiet
and correct in one of them.

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,262
So, I tell you what,

14
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:56,757

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,396
you be sure pick one
up for yourself, son.

16
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:13,729
Bye-bye.

17
00:01:16,268 --> 00:01:17,276
Showtime.

18
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:26,317
Shit, nigga, turn.

19
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:30,029
Man got clubs.

20
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,571
One day soon,
I'm walking out with a rolls, hear?

21
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,864
Way you been going to school
up in this here room, son,

22
00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:38,484
I suspect you're gonna walk out of here

23
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:40,738
with Morgan fucking Freeman
to drive it for you, too.

24
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:50,324
See y'all next time.

25
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:05,174
I'm up the grocery on Monroe.

26
00:02:05,273 --> 00:02:06,290
A'ight.

27
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:27,220
Water, one dollar.

28
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:47,951
The fuck?

29
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:52,018
You think I dream of coming to work
Up in this shit on a Sunday morning?

30
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:54,649
Tell all my friends
what a good job I got?

31
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:57,587
I'm working to support
a family, man.

32
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:00,799
Pretend I ain't talking to you.

33
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:03,217
Pretend like
I ain't even on this earth.

34
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,326
I know what you are.

35
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:08,312
And I ain't stepping to,
but I am a man.

36
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:12,037
And you just clip that shit and act like
you don't even know I'm there.

37
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:13,164
I don't.

38
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,728
I'm here.

39
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,890
Look, I told you
I wasn't stepping to you.

40
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,280
I ain't disrespecting you, son.

41
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,885
You want it to be one way.

42
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,524
What?

43
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,987
- You want it to be one way.
- I don't know what you're--

44
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,766
- You want it to be one way.
- Man, stop.

45
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,456
Stop saying that.

46
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:42,347
But it's the other way.

47
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:02,876
Episode 4x04 - Refugees

48
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:49,763
I'm saying, man.
The way she was all aah on Chiquan?

49
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:53,276
Like, like, like, like,
"laugh now, stanky bitch!

50
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:54,337
"Laugh now!

51
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:56,690
"How you like this?
How you like I cut your titties off?"

52
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:57,975
Man, get the fuck away from me.

53
00:05:57,995 --> 00:05:59,812
How you like I carve
your pussy to your chin?

54
00:05:59,852 --> 00:06:01,121
Yo, come on, come on.

55
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,742
He said leave him be.
So, leave him be.

56
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:04,441
- I'm just saying.
- You're just saying.

57
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,242
That's all you ever do,
just say.

58
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:07,584
Dude, shit was fucked up.

59
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:09,131
So, it was fucked up.

60
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:15,128
Her father...
killed, like, 3 police.

61
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:16,864
- What?
- Nah, it's true.

62
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:19,206
Her father kill like 3 police,
and her mama boil cats.

63
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,505
Nigga, please, man.

64
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:23,390
It's what I heard. She boil cats
and like serve 'em and shit.

65
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:25,915
Serve 'em to who?
Boiled-cat-eating motherfuckers?

66
00:06:25,954 --> 00:06:27,330
Who want him some boiled cats?

67
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:28,564
Heard that's how she live.

68
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:29,878
Maybe you been boiled.

69
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,901
Laetitia live up one of them
group homes off Edmondson.

70
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:34,835
In them places,

71
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:37,227
you don't need to eat cats
to make you crazy.

72
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:42,586
Hey, coach.

73
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:50,686
Yo, if the boy not coming,

74
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,859
you might as well let me
and Michael go in the ring.

75
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:54,619
Ain't none of y'all
seen Spider today?

76
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:55,912
I ain't seen him.

77
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:59,155
Now how in the hell he gonna fight
next week if he don't show up to train?

78
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:01,685
I tell you what.

79
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,793
Until the boy shows up for his lesson,

80
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:06,653
you can lace 'em up
and step on the mat one time.

81
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,947
No, no, no, no.

82
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:11,074
Not him.

83
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:12,694
Me.

84
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:17,273
I'm gonna show you
as gently as I can

85
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:18,866
how much you don't know,
a'ight?

86
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:20,506
- A'ight.
- Yeah, nigga, that's yo ass.

87
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:21,792
You about to get yo ass whipped.

88
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,557
- His ass?
- Hell, yeah.

89
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:25,249
I don't know who to be taking.

90
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:26,396
You about to get yo--

91
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,452
Your Sabbath's best?

92
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:35,056
You hang around, you can see
me preach on some young'uns.

93
00:07:35,313 --> 00:07:38,041
Solemn left
and sanctified right.

94
00:07:38,996 --> 00:07:40,965
Why you down here
on a Sunday, Deacon?

95
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:43,995
You need to see Ms. Donnelly
at Tilghman Middle.

96
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:46,289
She's got some custodial work,
you might call it.

97
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:47,631
Union wage.

98
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,738
Custodial.

99
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:50,266
See Ms. Donnelly tomorrow.

100
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:52,255
She can explain it
better than I can.

101
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:54,749
Tell me something.

102
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:58,754
How is it you got so much wisdom
About who should be where?

103
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:01,844
A good church man is always up
in everybody's shit.

104
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:03,953
That's how we do.

105
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:07,127
Yo, coach, you ready?

106
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,556
Who's winning?

107
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:17,978
No one wins.

108
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:20,051
One side just loses more slowly.

109
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,581
Why don't we
get out of the house?

110
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:26,317
Take a walk.

111
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,937
It's a nice day.

112
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:31,684
I got this talk
I got to give to my first period...

113
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,684
about what happened.

114
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,417
An hour.

115
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:38,970
I got...

116
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:41,983
I gotta say something
to those kids.

117
00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:43,054
I mean--

118
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,966
OK.

119
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:48,825
See?

120
00:08:48,924 --> 00:08:50,036
Somebody's winning.

121
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:56,218
Didn't expect you till tomorrow.

122
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:58,748
I heard my new squad
had the weekend shift.

123
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:01,800
And besides,
I figured if I got my shit

124
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,707
out of major crimes on a Sunday,

125
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,477
I wouldn't have to run into
that cocksucker Marimow.

126
00:09:07,722 --> 00:09:10,107
Marimow does not
cast off talent lightly.

127
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:12,647
He heaves it away with great force.

128
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:14,336
Freamon got here Friday.

129
00:09:14,824 --> 00:09:16,662
Yeah,
Lester's quick like that.

130
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:19,589
There's the Colonel's office.

131
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:21,880
This is my humble abode.

132
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:23,249
The board.

133
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:25,418
And over here,
this is your desk.

134
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:30,525
It's clean.

135
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:31,845
You'll fix that.

136
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:34,493
A clean desk is the sign
of a sick mind.

137
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:36,215
Homicide.

138
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,038
Damn.

139
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:39,977
I don't know
where your chair went.

140
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,528
Make that your first case.

141
00:09:41,616 --> 00:09:43,683
And put that down, will you?
You live here now.

142
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:47,643
Look!

143
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,309
Actual po-lice work.

144
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:56,716
Any of these?

145
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:58,688
He the one-- right there.

146
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,108
Just put it to Fruit's head,

147
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:03,426
and the next thing Fruit
on the ground flopping,

148
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:04,974
and his girl all screaming...

149
00:10:05,265 --> 00:10:06,449
and this pink shit

150
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:08,299
coming out the side of his head.

151
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:09,870
The Bunk.

152
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:11,983
Working weekends.

153
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:13,607
The man's dedicated.

154
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:17,408
I'm gonna partner you
with Crutchfield to get started.

155
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:20,027
You won't catch anything as a primary
for the first few months.

156
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,530
Give you time
to learn the basics.

157
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:26,172
Our h-files by year,
witness dump,

158
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:29,366
our coat and necktie mausoleum.

159
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:31,866
The coffee...

160
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,130
and, the mailboxes,
arranged by shift and squad.

161
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:38,937
Lester.

162
00:10:39,387 --> 00:10:41,758
I believe you two refugees
know each other well.

163
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:43,637
Still getting your head around it?

164
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:45,132
A bit, yeah.

165
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,124
You'll do fine. Just fine.

166
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:49,346
As tender as this
moment may be, Detective,

167
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:50,532
you've got mail.

168
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:56,903
You got Lyon
on your ass already?

169
00:10:57,393 --> 00:10:59,764
Another switch-up
on the methane probes.

170
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:02,035
I'd call that number.

171
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:04,777
Get on top of that shit
before you catch a case.

172
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:05,963
Chair or no chair.

173
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:23,469
What the hell is
a methane probe?

174
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,183
<i>Hello, Lathleen O'Shea.</i>

175
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:30,339
Yes, hello?

176
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:33,031
I need to speak with Mr. Lyon

177
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:34,538
About the protocols.

178
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,979
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

179
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:38,068
Mr. Lyon, please.

180
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:40,196
<i>You sound a little old for this, hon.</i>

181
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:41,705
Excuse me?

182
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:43,537
Who is this?

183
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:45,253
This is Detective
Greggs with the--

184
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:47,070
<i>this is the Baltimore city zoo.</i>

185
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:50,131
Fine, and this
is Detective Greggs.

186
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:52,447
<i>And you're calling</i>
<i>for a Mr. Lyon.</i>

187
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:57,426
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:58,012 --> 00:11:59,198
I misdialed.

189
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,027
Methane probe.

190
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,022
Scarred-up faggot.

191
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:15,995
I need to hunt him down

192
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,208
'cause there ain't no
protection against that shit.

193
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,762
Can't plan against that nigger.

194
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:22,826
It's like, like,
you know what he's like.

195
00:12:22,865 --> 00:12:23,854
What he like?

196
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,672
He like one of them
terrorist motherfuckers.

197
00:12:25,732 --> 00:12:27,227
Just blowing up shit just to.

198
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,168
Don't care who get hurt,
what kind of sense it makes.

199
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:31,316
He got a point.

200
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:33,469
And the government, right?

201
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:35,891
If they have one of them
terrorist attacks,

202
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,925
they cut delta
or whoever some slack?

203
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,115
The insurance companies,
the banks,

204
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,823
the whole Nasdaq and shit

205
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,936
get some time to pay back
what they owe

206
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:46,446
'cause the government know
ain't nothing they could do.

207
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:48,329
Yeah, I know you see it.

208
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:49,725
You see the big picture.

209
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:52,625
Problem with niggers today,
they always see the narrow view.

210
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:53,846
That's nice.

211
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:54,922
What?

212
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,458
Oh, you like that?

213
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:00,557
I had it for a long time now.

214
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:02,324
It's got some
sentimental values.

215
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:04,686
- Just a thing.
- What's the real value?

216
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:07,419
Real value?

217
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:09,029
I ain't much for sentiment.

218
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:10,416
Oh, you know.

219
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:12,156
It's been a while
since I checked.

220
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:15,592
I mean, the fluctuation
in the global economy and all.

221
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:16,778
I'll find out for you.

222
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,933
- You don't have to.
- I'll find out for you.

223
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:25,430
- Finger's swelled over the years.
- Need some help?

224
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:26,734
Yeah, man, you need help?

225
00:13:26,774 --> 00:13:28,336
Nah, I got it, I got it.

226
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:29,793
Maybe use some spit.

227
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,244
- I don't want the man's spit.
- No, I got it now.

228
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:38,844
Omar ain't no terrorist.

229
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:41,825
He just another nigger
with a gun.

230
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,053
And you ain't no
Delta Airlines neither.

231
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:45,914
You just a nigger
got your shit took.

232
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:47,419
So, bring me what you owe

233
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,543
and talk that global economy
mess somewhere else.

234
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:52,735
Feel me?

235
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,757
Yeah.

236
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:01,951
I got another game.

237
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:03,951
How much you down already?

238
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:07,317
Learning their ways
requires some patience.

239
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:08,683
Some money, too.

240
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:10,588
How much you need this time out?

241
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:12,751
Hundred and a half
ought to do.

242
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:14,306
A hundred and a half?

243
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:17,458
I take that chicken-nose
fool one day soon.

244
00:14:18,262 --> 00:14:19,803
Take super stick, too.

245
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:22,662
Take 'em all.

246
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:27,210
Else, maybe I get bored,
send you to take 'em.

247
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,640
And my point, Colonel Foerster,

248
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,215
is that your man Norris.

249
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:35,748
He's fucking the dog on this,
way I hear it.

250
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:39,129
Sir, this is a top priority case,
and Norris knows there's a possibility

251
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,735
- of a murdered state's witness.
- We don't even know yet

252
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,848
if that was the motive for the murder.

253
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,446
This is my point.

254
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:46,951
Norris is a pro, sir.

255
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,847
His clearance rate this
year says otherwise, Colonel.

256
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,836
Sir, Norris is good police.

257
00:14:56,954 --> 00:14:59,531
Look, ray, we need someone
who can work it hard,

258
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,945
work it around the clock,
work it till it falls.

259
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:05,630
And I understand we just pumped
some fresh blood into homicide.

260
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,391
Female.
Took one in the line a few years back.

261
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:10,077
She's never worked homicide.

262
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:11,676
Fresh eyes, then.

263
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:13,400
But with all due respect, sir,

264
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,377
if I could guarantee
that no further information

265
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,117
on this case would be
leaked to the press,

266
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:18,717
certainly not before election day,

267
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:21,588
would it be possible to keep
veteran investigators working it, sir?

268
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:23,471
I resent the implication.

269
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,409
My apologies, sir.

270
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,097
You killing my time,
coming up here.

271
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:37,615
And you ain't notice,
it's costing us money.

272
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:40,441
How am I gonna trust you
if you keep telling lies,

273
00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:42,087
Saying one thing
and doing another?

274
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:43,906
I just missed Friday, that's all.

275
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:45,710
Look, think on it like this.

276
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:48,142
School is work.
They the same thing right now.

277
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,907
So, you skipping out on school
is like not showing up for work.

278
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:54,005
And I done heard, made up,
and tested every excuse invented.

279
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:57,141
So, unless you dead or dying,
there ain't none you can use.

280
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,425
I told you I'm gonna go.

281
00:15:58,484 --> 00:15:59,967
Yeah, OK, I know.

282
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:01,626
For school
or out the business,

283
00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:02,739
you are gonna go.

284
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,078
Come on.

285
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:08,017
Falling behind now isn't the way
to start out a school year,

286
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:10,162
particularly after a 3-year hiatus.

287
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:12,264
We haven't seen you
since you enrolled.

288
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:14,477
Is there a reason
you haven't joined us?

289
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:22,458
Look, I know you
reaching out for Sherrod.

290
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:24,920
I want to apologize for the boy

291
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,727
'cause he's been working hard
at helping me get a business going.

292
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:29,031
But he need to be here though.

293
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,396
Ain't no bout a-doubt it.

294
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:32,268
It's up to him, isn't it?

295
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:35,013
That's what I been trying to say.
That's it right there.

296
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:36,634
What about it, young man?

297
00:16:37,349 --> 00:16:38,495
I'm good.

298
00:16:39,662 --> 00:16:40,671
OK.

299
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:44,374
One thing, though,
been bothering me, ma'am.

300
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,196
If Sherrod already missed
the last 3 years,

301
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,768
should he maybe be back in
the fifth or sixth grade,

302
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:52,505
instead of up with his age?
I mean, so he can follow the work.

303
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:54,007
Social promotion.

304
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:55,468
Excuse me?

305
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:58,150
We don't have the resources
to repeat grade levels,

306
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:01,346
and we feel to place the older
children in the younger classes

307
00:17:01,406 --> 00:17:02,611
is unfair to teachers

308
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,904
who are responsible
for maintaining order.

309
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:07,856
Your nephew has been
socially promoted.

310
00:17:08,389 --> 00:17:10,821
He's an eighth-grader,
headed to high school.

311
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:16,266
Sorry, but Ms. Johnson's
here about Qadriyyah.

312
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:17,631
Excuse me for a moment.

313
00:17:17,824 --> 00:17:20,216
...send her daddy up
here to deal with all y'all.

314
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:22,823
Bill, this is nuts.

315
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:24,101
I told him that.

316
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:26,831
You know if this gets out,
who do you think it's gonna land on?

317
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,397
I got two years to make 40
and a pension bump.

318
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:31,394
Look, I don't agree
with the call either,

319
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:32,481
but it's his call.

320
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,082
Not yours, not mine.

321
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:37,560
He's the one over city hall
every day getting his ass chewed.

322
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,595
I don't care about
nothing you say, man,

323
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:53,829
'cause if you start shit,

324
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:56,503
you can't complain how
somebody finish that shit.

325
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:58,427
Man, she was on her
from the beginning

326
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,327
with the mirror
and everything, man.

327
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:01,526
I wouldn't have waited.

328
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:08,655
Mr. Pryzbylewski,
this is Sherrod.

329
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:10,193
He's all yours.

330
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:11,406
OK.

331
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:13,057
Take a seat, Sherrod.

332
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:21,623
OK, listen up.

333
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:25,224
I'd like to-- everybody?

334
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:26,929
Everybody, I'd like to talk...

335
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:29,351
listen up!

336
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:33,758
Now, we all know something...

337
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:36,891
unpleasant
happened here Friday,

338
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,004
and, look, I know some
of you are still trying

339
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:41,141
to get your heads around--

340
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,897
ain't my head
got a big old gash.

341
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,922
And...
I'd like to discuss--

342
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,662
Yo, is it true that you police?

343
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:49,926
What?

344
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:53,181
Ms. Carmandy up in the office say
Mr. Prezbo, he police.

345
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,292
Yo, you police, man?

346
00:18:54,371 --> 00:18:55,634
You ever shoot somebody?

347
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:59,079
- I think we should talk about--
- He ain't shot no one. Look at him.

348
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:01,488
Yo, you ever bust a man
name Asante Graham?

349
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:03,379
Sometimes when
something bad happens--

350
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:05,170
- That your dad?
- Nah, my brother.

351
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:07,299
Why can't you tell us
if you shot somebody or not?

352
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:09,158
- What kind of gun you carry?
- You narco?

353
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:10,442
I used to be police.

354
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,293
Now I'm a teacher.

355
00:19:13,392 --> 00:19:15,526
But being a police isn't
just about carrying a gun.

356
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:16,600
Yeah, right.

357
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:18,955
It's about working with the community.

358
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:20,019
The community.

359
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:21,662
Y'all ain't been up in
my community

360
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:23,421
in a long time except
to wail on people.

361
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,085
Yo, Mr. P.,
you ever been shot?

362
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:26,667
I mean, like, bah.

363
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:32,687
Namond, that's enough.

364
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,076
Get up.

365
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:36,401
Get up.

366
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,784
Get back in your seats.

367
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,250
Thank you,
very entertaining.

368
00:19:39,317 --> 00:19:40,351
Sit down.

369
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:41,351
Get in your seats.

370
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:43,142
Sit down, sit down.

371
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:44,426
Kwaneese, sit down.

372
00:19:44,524 --> 00:19:45,790
Sit down, now.

373
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:47,945
Yo, Mr. P, you ever
choke somebody dead like...

374
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:52,422
Yo, you ever get videoed?

375
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:06,026
Mr. P,
Asante Graham.

376
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:07,377
You gots to know him.

377
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:09,043
He was a player, for real.

378
00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:32,641
He work Sunday to Thursday,

379
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,360
7:00 early to 5:00 late.

380
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:37,092
So, it ain't no
moonlighting thing, then.

381
00:20:37,191 --> 00:20:38,903
Nah, he ain't no real police.

382
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:41,390
He full-time on this
Mickey Mouse shit here.

383
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,934
What he do again?

384
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:45,950
Talked back.

385
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,408
Go over Hilltop now?

386
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:51,092
Yeah, we got that, too.

387
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:58,279
Looks like we got that.

388
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:01,443
See ya.

389
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:09,908
Decision time, son.

390
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:11,242
Yo, what's your play?

391
00:21:21,395 --> 00:21:24,291
I told Little Kevin right there
to shoot y'all both in the head twice.

392
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,258
But seeing as he
done walked away.

393
00:21:26,575 --> 00:21:27,740
Oh, you funny.

394
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:30,714
Yeah,
I guess I'm on your package.

395
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:34,286
Where the boy at-- Michael?

396
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,290
He ain't no regular.
He's just working off a debt.

397
00:21:38,526 --> 00:21:39,712
Why? Why you care?

398
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:41,005
Never mind you why.

399
00:21:41,203 --> 00:21:43,159
"Why" ain't in your repertoire
no more, nigger.

400
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:04,999
60-40 split on that.

401
00:22:05,295 --> 00:22:07,302
Do not be messing
with Marlo's money.

402
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,895
Randy Wagstaff.

403
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:21,423
You aren't a sixth grader,
are you?

404
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:23,520
Hey, Ms. Reese.

405
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:25,061
If you were a sixth-grader,

406
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:27,116
it would mean you and the rest
of the knuckleheads

407
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:29,534
would still be in my
first period English class.

408
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:31,965
And that would mean
it was two years ago.

409
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:34,420
And that would mean time stands
still at Tilghman Middle,

410
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,178
and that would be a catastrophe.

411
00:22:36,852 --> 00:22:38,968
I just forgot
and wore my old shirt today.

412
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:42,432
Well, if this isn't your lunch,
then where is your hall pass?

413
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:49,744
Why not just write it in crayon?

414
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:51,696
Come on.

415
00:22:54,257 --> 00:22:55,731
Deacon says you're a good man.

416
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:58,623
- Good enough to swing a mop, I guess.
- A mop?

417
00:22:58,731 --> 00:23:01,105
- More like a vacuum cleaner.
- What?

418
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:04,035
I got a few fellas like you
to help me out every September.

419
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:05,550
You go out on the street,

420
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:07,717
you find these kids,
you drag them in.

421
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:09,793
A truant officer.

422
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:13,563
The system hasn't been funded
for truant officers in 20 years.

423
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:16,529
Where the hell you think you are,
Montgomery county?

424
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,061
Nah, I keep a couple custodial positions
unfilled every year just for this.

425
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,501
Those kids?

426
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,762
You haul 'em in,
you cross 'em off the list.

427
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:27,494
Each kid, one time,
clear the list.

428
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,977
Come October?

429
00:23:29,595 --> 00:23:31,037
You start on the list again.

430
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:35,160
Job's yours if you want it.
Pays 12 an hour.

431
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,333
Excuse me, hon.

432
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:37,479
Sit.

433
00:23:37,886 --> 00:23:39,763
Tilghman Middle School,
can I help you?

434
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:46,958
Will do.
You're welcome.

435
00:23:50,941 --> 00:23:52,226
Why'd you leave class?

436
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:53,697
I got hungry.

437
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,091
Couldn't concentrate.

438
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:56,888
Maybe, Randy,
you had another reason

439
00:23:56,947 --> 00:23:58,331
for running the halls, huh?

440
00:23:58,608 --> 00:23:59,793
Tagging walls, maybe?

441
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,358
- You know I don't.
- I don't know anything.

442
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:05,624
I know it's the second week,
and I got walls covered with tags.

443
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:08,057
Does that make you feel good,
walking past that?

444
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:09,937
- I don't know.
- Maybe you don't know

445
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:11,597
'cause you're the one
doing the marking.

446
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:13,069
- I'm not.
- Then who is?

447
00:24:22,385 --> 00:24:23,784
- Ms. Thompson?
- Yes, ma'am.

448
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:26,632
Could you get me the number
for Randy Wagstaff's foster mom?

449
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,273
What you want to call Ms. Anna for?

450
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,635
Because you're skipping class,

451
00:24:29,655 --> 00:24:30,969
running the halls, maybe worse.

452
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:32,324
She's got a right to know.

453
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,379
- Is this her work number?
- Yes, ma'am.

454
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,898
Hold on.

455
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,598
Wait.

456
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:41,696
The new girl, Greggs.

457
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:44,425
Sir, if I may respectfully--

458
00:24:44,492 --> 00:24:46,153
Look, Norris has a full plate, OK?

459
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:48,295
The Braddock case goes to Greggs.

460
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,778
His plate is fine.

461
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,986
No, it's not.
His plate's a pile of shit, OK?

462
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,331
Listen to me.

463
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,085
Burrell wants this case
stalled until everybody votes.

464
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:57,619
And Rawls?

465
00:24:58,435 --> 00:25:00,057
What the fuck I know what Rawls wants?

466
00:25:00,156 --> 00:25:01,350
He never said shit,

467
00:25:01,563 --> 00:25:04,318
and let me tell you something,
even he knows this is fucked up.

468
00:25:04,614 --> 00:25:05,761
I have this correct?

469
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,058
Were pulling a veteran off
a pending case and giving it to a rook

470
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:12,006
so as not to make timely
progress on said case?

471
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,516
The Braddock case to Greggs.

472
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,518
A pilot program.

473
00:25:18,597 --> 00:25:20,257
For one of your
middle schools, yes.

474
00:25:20,356 --> 00:25:22,202
A $200,000 grant is attached.

475
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:24,138
Free money.

476
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,501
I'm just trying
to help here, Mrs. Conway.

477
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,735
Help how?

478
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:33,348
You say that your target group
is repeat violent offenders.

479
00:25:33,697 --> 00:25:36,773
Are you in any way suggesting that
the system's lost control of the school?

480
00:25:36,832 --> 00:25:38,709
No, no,
that's not what I'm suggesting at all.

481
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:39,814
The system's fine.

482
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:41,217
The system's great.

483
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:43,580
I mean, this isn't about the system.

484
00:25:43,851 --> 00:25:45,686
We're just gonna try to find a way

485
00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:47,306
to get to some of the troubled kids

486
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,283
who won't be in
the system too much longer.

487
00:25:52,193 --> 00:25:55,179
Well,
look, just make sure there's no fuss.

488
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:57,763
I mean, nothing that gets
anyone upset, you know?

489
00:25:57,966 --> 00:25:59,152
There's an election going on,

490
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:02,240
and we don't want to put our schools
in the middle of that mess.

491
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:03,784
No, indeed.

492
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:18,670
Humping a radio car
like a young sprite.

493
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,030
I'm a little bit proud
to know you, officer Mcnulty.

494
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:22,345
Just a little bit?

495
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:24,895
It ain't like there aren't
better things you could be doing.

496
00:27:24,982 --> 00:27:27,002
- Like what?
- See, I told you, Lester.

497
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,860
The worm has turned for my boy.

498
00:27:29,426 --> 00:27:31,201
So, I heard they
torpedoed your wiretap.

499
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:33,091
Yeah, they sent us
a new Lieutenant.

500
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,554
Marimow from E-and-T.

501
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:35,469
The unit killer.

502
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:37,772
Lester and Kima already
bailed to homicide,

503
00:27:37,812 --> 00:27:40,303
and now Sydnor's looking to jump
at the first good opening.

504
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:41,801
So, major crimes is dead?

505
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,679
Yeah, Lester killed it good.

506
00:27:44,024 --> 00:27:45,446
I went looking for the money.

507
00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:47,390
Guys like you,
you never learn.

508
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:48,565
Guys like me?

509
00:27:48,664 --> 00:27:50,078
Yeah, 13 years--

510
00:27:50,274 --> 00:27:51,867
- 4 months.
- 4 months.

511
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:55,252
You guys call
for backup or what?

512
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:56,339
Yeah.

513
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,771
We got arrest papers on a murder

514
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,667
for one Curtis Anderson,
a.k.a. Lex.

515
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:02,382
He's been on the wing
for a couple weeks,

516
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:05,187
so I don't expect him at his mama's,
but you never know.

517
00:28:05,464 --> 00:28:07,524
- What's the address?
- 643 Harlem.

518
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:10,472
How about you taking the door
with me for old time's sake, Jim?

519
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,542
I'll take the back, gents.

520
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,050
The back?

521
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:16,865
Damn, junior,
the worm has turned for you.

522
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:19,829
You know what they say about the man
who volunteers to take the back?

523
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:21,055
He buys.

524
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,766
B&O Tavern.

525
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:24,356
Tonight at 9:00, son.

526
00:28:24,475 --> 00:28:25,892
I throw myself out after one.

527
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,216
- Shit.
- You don't believe me, ask Bunk.

528
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:30,497
True.

529
00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:42,370
The bedroom's clear.

530
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:43,829
Yeah, basement, too.

531
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:45,120
Clear.

532
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:46,562
Yeah.

533
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,541
Clear.

534
00:28:58,443 --> 00:28:59,793
9:00 tonight, Mcnulty.

535
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:01,742
B&O Tavern.

536
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:09,587
He's not here.
I told you.

537
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:17,317
Is he coming home again?

538
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:24,569
Ma'am, is your son alive?

539
00:29:27,463 --> 00:29:28,707
Because if he's not,

540
00:29:29,704 --> 00:29:31,246
we can end this right now.

541
00:29:32,012 --> 00:29:35,807
Otherwise, we've got a witness
that gives us a murder warrant,

542
00:29:36,594 --> 00:29:38,879
and that warrant says
that we can come through your door

543
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:40,402
as many times as necessary.

544
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,507
I don't know where my son is.

545
00:29:47,924 --> 00:29:49,390
It's like them birds of yours.

546
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:51,778
They go out,
and they fly around the city,

547
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:53,622
they free to do as they do.

548
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,788
End of the day,
they come back here,

549
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:57,745
get water, get fed,

550
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,389
'cause they know you got this place
set up regular as the rain.

551
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:03,703
No surprises,
'cause at the end of the day,

552
00:30:03,763 --> 00:30:05,554
a man don't want no surprises.

553
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:07,256
You know, birds neither.

554
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,275
Same as what I'm offering.

555
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,176
You part of a co-op,

556
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:14,220
a whole lot of surprises
you never worry about again.

557
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,140
You just do as you do,

558
00:30:16,598 --> 00:30:18,545
knowing the product
will always be there

559
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,157
and be the finest quality.

560
00:30:20,717 --> 00:30:22,918
Knowing that if one
of yours takes a pinch,

561
00:30:23,308 --> 00:30:25,492
he got a lawyer
and a bondsman

562
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:27,917
waiting for him before
he even step out the wagon.

563
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,304
I know how to hire lawyers.

564
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:31,148
It ain't just about the lawyers.

565
00:30:31,587 --> 00:30:33,412
It's having a connection
so that you know

566
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:35,176
before the bust even go down.

567
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:37,800
What I got to give up
to get that good dope?

568
00:30:37,898 --> 00:30:39,048
Muscle.

569
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:40,385
You got muscle.

570
00:30:40,945 --> 00:30:42,060
You stand with us,

571
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:44,372
we run these New York boys
right out of East Baltimore.

572
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:46,191
Fuck I care about East Baltimore?

573
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:51,106
The point of the co-op
is we stand together.

574
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:53,452
We share information,

575
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,600
And no one fucks
with any of us.

576
00:30:55,995 --> 00:30:57,496
No one fucks with me now.

577
00:30:58,085 --> 00:31:01,387
Well, that don't mean there couldn't be
some unforeseen cir--

578
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,480
No one fucks with me now.

579
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:19,481
African colors.

580
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:20,788
Subtle.

581
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:24,446
Tony Gray is pulling 24% now.

582
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:27,396
You need new colors
and a new message, Clarence.

583
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:29,205
You need to rally the base.

584
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:31,874
You want me to start
wearing dashikis?

585
00:31:32,418 --> 00:31:34,078
Go all Marion Barry and shit?

586
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:35,629
I'll tell you what I would like.

587
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:38,306
Another 75 in cash
for walk-around money.

588
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,112
75?

589
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:44,503
Call another game.

590
00:31:46,217 --> 00:31:47,401
It's a waste of time,

591
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,555
and right now,
time is everything.

592
00:31:50,028 --> 00:31:52,244
They're gonna spit
in your eye and endorse Royce.

593
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:54,943
They only waited this long out
of respect to Tony Gray.

594
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,032
Otherwise, they gave
it to Royce months ago.

595
00:31:57,111 --> 00:31:58,244
That's not the point.

596
00:31:58,323 --> 00:32:00,870
You go there uninvited,
and you're only gonna piss them off.

597
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:02,021
Am I?

598
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:05,886
Or do I piss them off even more
by pretending that they don't exist,

599
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,330
that I don't need them?

600
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:09,929
I've door-to-doored every
neighborhood in this city

601
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,719
saying I'm ready to be
mayor to all of it.

602
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,432
Not just my base,
but all of it.

603
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:15,231
What does it say
I don't go see these guys?

604
00:32:15,271 --> 00:32:16,396
He's right.

605
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:18,779
They endorse Royce, fine.

606
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:20,141
The hell else they gonna do?

607
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:21,932
But what they say and don't say

608
00:32:21,991 --> 00:32:24,087
from the pulpit the Sunday
before the primary?

609
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:25,904
We still got a dog
in that fight.

610
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:27,741
I do this right,
they'll respect it.

611
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,906
And if they don't,

612
00:32:29,265 --> 00:32:30,697
at least they get to see

613
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,184
a begging-ass white man
on his knees.

614
00:32:33,572 --> 00:32:35,864
Always a feel-good moment
for the folks.

615
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,639
And as to my attendance
at council meetings,

616
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,528
those who know the job
understand there is more

617
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:49,771
to being a councilperson
than just the meetings.

618
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:51,290
Yes, Charles.

619
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:54,205
Yeah, they putting a halfway
house at the end of my block.

620
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:55,410
Addicts and such.

621
00:32:55,449 --> 00:32:57,737
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

622
00:32:58,099 --> 00:32:59,408
Where you living at, sir?

623
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:00,942
800 block north Carrollton.

624
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,170
Oh, I'm gonna take
a look into that.

625
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:06,614
Is there anyone with a question
for any of the other candidates?

626
00:33:07,298 --> 00:33:09,947
Anyone with an issue,
a concern?

627
00:33:11,085 --> 00:33:12,714
Well, I would say
that with regard to

628
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:15,002
the gentleman's concern
about the halfway house

629
00:33:15,307 --> 00:33:17,134
That while I share your concern,

630
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:20,735
it's also true that the city has
thousands of drug addicts in recovery,

631
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:23,736
and those halfway houses and shelters
have to go someplace.

632
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,053
Though not in white neighborhoods.

633
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,648
Ma'am, could I see that?
That Royce flier.

634
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:34,665
Well, that is
a fair point as well.

635
00:33:34,744 --> 00:33:36,681
But these are people--

636
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,363
our brothers and sisters,
our children, our friends,

637
00:33:40,993 --> 00:33:42,717
and they are trying
to change their lives,

638
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:45,299
and so it's up to us to
be responsible for them.

639
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:49,431
Feel good to miss a hand, huh?

640
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:50,733
What's the point?

641
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:52,907
Eventually, we all got to ante up.

642
00:33:53,497 --> 00:33:54,623
Yeah, we do.

643
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:56,581
But I can't believe he
had the balls enough

644
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,004
to call two games in one month.

645
00:33:58,064 --> 00:33:59,146
I mean, please.

646
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:00,996
He's loading up
on walk-around money.

647
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,331
He wants cash on the street
come election day.

648
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:04,796
Carcetti got to him.

649
00:34:05,224 --> 00:34:06,549
Call it a war chest, right?

650
00:34:07,002 --> 00:34:08,642
Maybe we got us a war this time.

651
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:15,279
I wouldn't mind if he wasn't
so fucking ugly with it.

652
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,785
That two pair he bet on--
Right into Roger's trip 9s*.

653
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:19,850
I folded on a flush.

654
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,610
Full boat.
4 hands ago.

655
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:24,946
It's immoral, what it is.

656
00:34:29,092 --> 00:34:30,654
So, what's the game, gents?

657
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:32,295
Clarence's deal.

658
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:35,866
Texas hold 'em.

659
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:38,432
I begin to understand
the popularity of this game.

660
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,968
No limit.

661
00:34:42,565 --> 00:34:44,046
Oh, peachy.

662
00:34:46,743 --> 00:34:49,106
I was beginning to think
you'd lost it, son.

663
00:34:50,749 --> 00:34:52,144
That living room shrine of hers

664
00:34:52,184 --> 00:34:54,595
would have shamed
Elvis and Tupac both.

665
00:34:56,034 --> 00:34:57,461
Her son's deader than both of 'em.

666
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,124
She's just too scared to say so.

667
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,750
That shit wasn't there
first time I talked to her.

668
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:03,033
I'd have seen it.

669
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,738
You being a detective and all.

670
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:11,857
Hey, look, she got a friend.

671
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,421
She too young for you, boy.

672
00:35:16,022 --> 00:35:17,110
Young?

673
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,474
They get younger, William.

674
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,400
Skinnier, too.
We don't.

675
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,723
Younger, skinnier.
Where's Jimmy?

676
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,142
That's just the nature of things.

677
00:35:25,201 --> 00:35:28,689
Age is age, fat is fat,
and nature is nature.

678
00:35:28,904 --> 00:35:29,991
Pitiful.

679
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:32,332
Pitiless.
Nature don't care.

680
00:35:33,279 --> 00:35:34,722
Nature just is.

681
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:37,087
Now my boy, Marlo,

682
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:38,821
I thought he was skewing that.

683
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:40,156
Screwing what?

684
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:41,507
The boy's a young lion.

685
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:43,120
Hello, is Mr. Lyon home?

686
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,673
And a lion has to have his kill.

687
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:48,486
Methane probe for Mr. Lyon.

688
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,335
So, then where are my bodies?

689
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:55,453
Here I am over here on the one hand
without a body in 6 months,

690
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:59,207
and here you are looking for a suspect
who's most likely dead

691
00:35:59,918 --> 00:36:02,507
and most likely
for dropping one of Marlo's.

692
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:08,652
And, again, if he's dead,
where's that body?

693
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,764
You know what
the plural of pussy is?

694
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:12,184
Puss-l.

695
00:36:12,342 --> 00:36:13,407
Jimmy taught me that.

696
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:15,244
Where's he putting the bodies, Bunk?

697
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:16,483
In the sewers?

698
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,150
Rogue funeral home, maybe?

699
00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:20,898
Yeah, they teach that fancy-ass Latin
at them catholic schools.

700
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:22,294
You remember the Eddy Crane case?

701
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:25,978
Word was they put him
in an acid vat down near Curtis bay.

702
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:28,183
They're coming up on us now.

703
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,882
Now, for a Westside boy
like Marlo Stanfield,

704
00:36:31,244 --> 00:36:33,616
that would be the traditional
dumping grounds.

705
00:36:33,698 --> 00:36:35,038
- Hey, girl.
- Right?

706
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:36,105
Hey, girl.

707
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:37,706
- Right?
- What?

708
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:42,948
Jimmy.

709
00:36:48,024 --> 00:36:50,436
Tying to get some of that puss-l.

710
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,205
What the hell you
still sitting here for?

711
00:36:55,957 --> 00:36:58,313
Fucking huxtables and shit, man.

712
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:02,312
There they go right there.

713
00:37:04,176 --> 00:37:05,179
They still with school.

714
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:09,499
Shit. Just so they can spring out
that shit pile every day.

715
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,569
Make a good run at that boy,

716
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:14,414
he'll be on a corner,
no problem, man.

717
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:16,245
Yeah, we gonna see.

718
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:20,477
You hung over?

719
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,732
Just saying you look like shit.

720
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:26,516
Know what you need
at a crime scene?

721
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,491
Rubber gloves.

722
00:37:28,886 --> 00:37:30,111
Soft eyes.

723
00:37:30,778 --> 00:37:32,794
Like I'm supposed
to cry and shit?

724
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:35,538
You got soft eyes,
you can see the whole thing.

725
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:37,774
You got hard eyes,

726
00:37:38,254 --> 00:37:39,853
you're staring at the same tree,

727
00:37:39,972 --> 00:37:41,336
missing the forest.

728
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,720
Oh, zen shit.

729
00:37:44,813 --> 00:37:46,508
Soft eyes, grasshopper.

730
00:37:58,856 --> 00:38:01,023
Lividity puts
the time of death at 7:48,

731
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:02,841
- give or take.
- Noted.

732
00:38:03,202 --> 00:38:05,340
- You're gonna want to get a chem-stat.
- You think?

733
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:07,283
- Couldn't hurt.
- CDC, too?

734
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:09,041
- Splatter distance?
- Yeah, definitely.

735
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:12,210
You know, where the hell
did my q-tips go?

736
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,839
Don't sweat it.
I got mine right here.

737
00:38:13,906 --> 00:38:15,367
Oh, good. It's cool.

738
00:38:15,446 --> 00:38:17,127
You want to take a look?
Won't bite.

739
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:23,229
Hey, don't forget
the, stippling.

740
00:38:24,654 --> 00:38:25,682
I'm a rookie?

741
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,006
- There's something in his hand.
- Oh, yeah?

742
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:30,970
Give her some tweezers.

743
00:38:43,778 --> 00:38:45,003
"Tater killed me."

744
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:50,168
Is it typed? 'Cause that would
hold up a lot better in court.

745
00:39:00,663 --> 00:39:01,976
Phone number in the other hand.

746
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,334
A standard
confidentiality agreement.

747
00:39:09,072 --> 00:39:10,338
And this one?

748
00:39:10,753 --> 00:39:12,315
Oh, that one indemnifies us

749
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:14,666
should you or any
of your staff be injured.

750
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:32,395
Who wants to get
some learning today?

751
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:33,763
I roll up front with you?

752
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:35,465
You got dibs
in the back, little man.

753
00:39:35,524 --> 00:39:36,731
Let's go.

754
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:38,290
Come on.

755
00:39:38,538 --> 00:39:39,734
Don't worry about it.

756
00:39:39,813 --> 00:39:41,098
We catch him later.

757
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,164
Yeah, little man's so excited

758
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:45,730
about what's on that
blackboard, he gonna race us.

759
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,095
What's the line on us so far?

760
00:39:54,254 --> 00:39:55,784
In the teacher's lounge, I mean.

761
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:58,377
They're saying you're
this year's band-aid.

762
00:39:58,756 --> 00:39:59,877
Is that how you feel?

763
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:01,699
I was hoping for more than that.

764
00:40:02,075 --> 00:40:03,438
This year's splint?

765
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:05,443
Hey, Ms. Sampson.

766
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:07,371
Yo, he police.

767
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:14,393
I mean, the school
system seems benign.

768
00:40:14,802 --> 00:40:16,743
And I get the sense
north avenue might give us

769
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:18,492
some latitude, if not support.

770
00:40:18,802 --> 00:40:19,810
You think so?

771
00:40:20,093 --> 00:40:21,932
You sound doubtful.

772
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,570
You can tell the days
by their faces.

773
00:40:27,036 --> 00:40:28,658
The best day is Wednesday.

774
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:32,525
That's the farthest they get from home,
from whatever's going on in the streets.

775
00:40:32,794 --> 00:40:34,336
You see smiles then.

776
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:36,674
Monday is angry.

777
00:40:37,203 --> 00:40:40,397
Tuesdays, they're caught
between Monday and Wednesday,

778
00:40:40,476 --> 00:40:42,733
so it could go either way.

779
00:40:44,461 --> 00:40:45,706
Thursdays...

780
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:48,579
they're feeling
that weekend coming.

781
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,723
Friday, it's bad again.

782
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:53,813
This is where I leave you.

783
00:40:57,575 --> 00:40:58,563
Your class.

784
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:00,566
Language arts, huh?

785
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:01,692
Yes.

786
00:41:02,571 --> 00:41:04,707
Anyway, you should see it without me.

787
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,166
They behave differently
when I'm around.

788
00:41:09,115 --> 00:41:10,222
No doubt.

789
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:31,848
What do you think this 20 stands for?

790
00:41:32,474 --> 00:41:34,818
No, it's not the number of days
you've been suspended.

791
00:41:35,415 --> 00:41:38,616
It's not the number of years you'll
spend in prison if you don't shape up.

792
00:41:39,225 --> 00:41:41,497
It's 50% below average.

793
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:44,130
It's 30% below failure even.

794
00:41:44,974 --> 00:41:47,205
But, really, it stands
for the amount of interest

795
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,817
you're taking in your own future.

796
00:41:57,124 --> 00:41:59,437
The next question is worth two points.

797
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,114
Who can tell me
why was Clarence Mitchell Jr.

798
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:05,982
important to the civil
rights movement?

799
00:42:06,049 --> 00:42:08,382
- I know!
- And I can tell by Shalanta's smile,

800
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:10,422
she's gonna win for the blue team.

801
00:42:12,858 --> 00:42:14,604
Hey, yo, did you see
that one over there?

802
00:42:22,145 --> 00:42:24,344
Anybody here Deshawn Price?

803
00:42:24,756 --> 00:42:25,922
Never heard of him.

804
00:42:27,536 --> 00:42:28,447
And what's your name?

805
00:42:28,727 --> 00:42:31,158
Herbert Brown.
This the roundup van, right?

806
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,479
Oh, yeah, here you go, my man.
Come on.

807
00:42:33,546 --> 00:42:35,024
Oh, no! Yo, no.

808
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:36,827
Yeah, see?

809
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:38,922
Howard Brown,
that's my brother.

810
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,867
He over on McHenry Street
if you want him.

811
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:42,395
I was just in school on Friday,

812
00:42:42,415 --> 00:42:44,115
so I'm fat until October.

813
00:42:44,877 --> 00:42:46,475
Sorry.
Hold up, my man.

814
00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:47,701
Naw, he's right.

815
00:42:49,182 --> 00:42:50,928
School gets a certain
amount of money

816
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:53,771
for each kid that shows
up one day in September

817
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,211
and one day in October.

818
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,411
One day?

819
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:58,787
After that, they don't
lose the government money,

820
00:42:59,275 --> 00:43:01,094
- so we done with it.
- Naw, naw, man.

821
00:43:01,154 --> 00:43:02,288
School is school.

822
00:43:02,703 --> 00:43:04,976
Yeah, well,
I'm just trying to school you, brother.

823
00:43:05,275 --> 00:43:06,343
A'ight.

824
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:08,873
Which one of y'all still
need your September day?

825
00:43:09,496 --> 00:43:11,008
Get it over with now,

826
00:43:11,169 --> 00:43:13,142
we won't be messing with y'all later.

827
00:43:26,113 --> 00:43:27,279
What up, Butch?

828
00:43:41,424 --> 00:43:42,806
How do we begin?

829
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,996
You the one called the meet.

830
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,827
Why don't we begin by you
respecting my time

831
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:50,092
and getting to it.

832
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:53,048
First of all,
I heard you may be

833
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,202
under the impression
I was somehow involved

834
00:43:55,261 --> 00:43:56,744
with the late Mr. Bell

835
00:43:57,072 --> 00:43:59,542
In his play against you
with brother Mouzone.

836
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:02,094
I was no way involved.

837
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:05,293
Stringer came at me to set up
the parley with you.

838
00:44:05,582 --> 00:44:09,298
He used me like he used y'all,
I feel the need to say.

839
00:44:09,742 --> 00:44:11,002
It's said then.

840
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:12,504
Tip out on it.

841
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:14,139
Businessman such as myself

842
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:17,579
does not believe in bad blood
with a man such as yourself.

843
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,502
Disturbs the sleep.

844
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:20,965
Oh, I bet it do.

845
00:44:21,971 --> 00:44:24,184
By way of amends,
a proposition.

846
00:44:25,783 --> 00:44:27,934
I know of a card game
on the West side.

847
00:44:28,263 --> 00:44:30,221
High rollers,
lots of cash money.

848
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:31,783
Boxcar-sized.

849
00:44:32,151 --> 00:44:33,435
You trying to set me up, Joe?

850
00:44:33,494 --> 00:44:34,934
You ever known me to be stupid?

851
00:44:35,121 --> 00:44:37,201
I'm trying to make things
right here with you.

852
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,865
How much we talking about?

853
00:44:39,015 --> 00:44:41,217
If there ain't at least
a few hundred k in that room,

854
00:44:41,234 --> 00:44:42,461
I wish myself blind.

855
00:44:43,787 --> 00:44:45,072
Serious, Joe.

856
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:46,532
I say again--

857
00:44:46,888 --> 00:44:49,101
have you ever known me
to be a stupid man?

858
00:44:49,844 --> 00:44:51,092
What are the strings?

859
00:44:51,171 --> 00:44:52,200
No strings.

860
00:44:52,427 --> 00:44:53,515
What's your cut then?

861
00:44:53,614 --> 00:44:54,731
Quarter of the take.

862
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,063
I scope this
and it don't look right,

863
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:02,092
I'm gonna come back
on you now, Joe.

864
00:45:10,947 --> 00:45:12,349
Where did everybody go?

865
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:19,946
Which one of you is Sergeant Hauk?

866
00:45:20,104 --> 00:45:21,112
Sir.

867
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:23,029
And you must be Dozerman.

868
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,029
Yes, sir.

869
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,698
Welcome to major crimes.

870
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,773
I'm Lieutenant Marimow.

871
00:45:29,049 --> 00:45:30,840
I see you just made Sergeant

872
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:34,522
after driving the mayor around
for less than 3 months.

873
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,670
You must be a hell of a driver.

874
00:45:38,383 --> 00:45:39,694
Anyone here?

875
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:42,260
- Greggs, Freamon?
- Sydnor and Massey.

876
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:44,594
And they're on the street,
making rips.

877
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:46,430
That's what we do here now.

878
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,572
We get on the street
and we rip and run.

879
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:52,329
Can you get with that, Sergeant?

880
00:45:52,507 --> 00:45:54,126
The Western District way, sir.

881
00:46:01,546 --> 00:46:02,673
Thank you.

882
00:46:03,088 --> 00:46:04,096
Thank you.

883
00:46:22,067 --> 00:46:23,352
Thanks for seeing me.

884
00:46:24,225 --> 00:46:26,280
I understand you've already
heard from mayor Royce

885
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,348
and from councilman Gray,

886
00:46:27,388 --> 00:46:30,254
and I'd like to thank you
for being able to join in this process.

887
00:46:33,604 --> 00:46:36,244
I don't expect to walk out
of this room today with an endorsement

888
00:46:36,284 --> 00:46:38,933
from the interdenominational
ministerial alliance.

889
00:46:39,475 --> 00:46:40,620
I don't.

890
00:46:41,116 --> 00:46:42,267
But the point is

891
00:46:42,436 --> 00:46:45,353
I think I can be a better mayor
for Baltimore than the present one.

892
00:46:45,544 --> 00:46:47,557
I voted for Clarence Royce 8 years ago.

893
00:46:47,715 --> 00:46:49,652
I voted for him 4 years after that.

894
00:46:50,096 --> 00:46:52,744
I felt there was
promise in the man.

895
00:46:54,001 --> 00:46:55,562
But now, I'm disappointed.

896
00:46:56,174 --> 00:46:58,045
I'm disappointed
and I'm angry

897
00:46:58,449 --> 00:46:59,891
at the crime and the waste

898
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:02,026
and the damage
done to so many neighborhoods.

899
00:47:02,105 --> 00:47:04,419
Not just in my district,
but here on the West side.

900
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:06,565
Pimlico, Cherry Hill,
Edmondson Village.

901
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,843
Wherever I go, people
want the same things.

902
00:47:08,942 --> 00:47:10,753
They need the same things,

903
00:47:11,368 --> 00:47:13,009
but they're just not getting them.

904
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:15,951
I'm gonna change that.

905
00:47:16,553 --> 00:47:18,727
I'm not gonna ask
for your vote now.

906
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:20,683
Maybe I haven't earned it yet.

907
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,753
But I am here to say
that when I am mayor,

908
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,982
my door is open to you,
regardless of who you endorse.

909
00:47:26,421 --> 00:47:29,517
And I want you to remember that I came
here today to say these things.

910
00:47:34,556 --> 00:47:35,616
Thank you.

911
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,159
Councilman.

912
00:47:41,398 --> 00:47:42,485
Thank you for coming.

913
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:50,813
OK, I'm gonna need a A.P.B.
on a motherfucker named Tater.

914
00:47:57,076 --> 00:47:59,527
"Call Mr. Sweet A.S.A.P."?

915
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:02,045
Let me guess--

916
00:48:02,273 --> 00:48:03,889
The gay and lesbian alliance.

917
00:48:04,575 --> 00:48:05,979
She's catching on, boys.

918
00:48:09,445 --> 00:48:10,845
Oh, and what do you want?

919
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:12,711
Another methane probe?

920
00:48:13,086 --> 00:48:15,695
Or some other "CSI"
bullshit that don't exist?

921
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:19,605
You're the primary
on the Braddock case.

922
00:48:19,718 --> 00:48:21,077
The dead witness.

923
00:48:21,335 --> 00:48:23,114
Norris is back in the rotation.

924
00:48:23,724 --> 00:48:24,733
What?

925
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:30,846
You caught your first murder.

926
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,894
Kudos.

927
00:48:40,392 --> 00:48:41,776
Come on, man, hell.

928
00:48:45,061 --> 00:48:46,775
Do that to whoever be snitching.

929
00:48:47,203 --> 00:48:48,320
Who snitching?

930
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:50,633
Don't know,
but kids be snitching.

931
00:48:50,923 --> 00:48:52,725
Rashid got suspended
for tagging walls, yo.

932
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:53,841
Y'all ain't heard?

933
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:56,150
How you know he ain't just get
caught with a paint can?

934
00:48:56,229 --> 00:48:58,956
'Cause Ms. Donnelly came
and pulled him out of the classroom.

935
00:49:00,623 --> 00:49:01,863
Yo, I'll see y'all later, man.

936
00:49:01,923 --> 00:49:03,128
Yo, you going past the gym?

937
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:05,140
- All right, man.
- Peace, peace.

938
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,868
I ain't gonna tell you again.
Give me the remote.

939
00:49:15,091 --> 00:49:16,811
Did y'all learn something today?

940
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:20,618
Y'all learn something today?

941
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:22,558
Yeah.

942
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:23,899
What y'all learn?

943
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:28,340
I said give me the remote.

944
00:49:30,037 --> 00:49:31,176
Give it.

945
00:49:32,031 --> 00:49:33,434
Math your favorite, right?

946
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:34,787
Start with it.

947
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:36,100
I like math.

948
00:49:36,317 --> 00:49:37,805
Yeah, you good at it, too.

949
00:49:39,326 --> 00:49:41,703
Watched this show 5 damn times.

950
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:53,250
Hey, you good?

951
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:55,550
All right, man.

952
00:50:00,975 --> 00:50:02,813
So, it turns out the one girl...

953
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,474
200-something stitches
to close her up.

954
00:50:06,146 --> 00:50:08,623
She's looking at a lot of rehab
and maybe more surgery.

955
00:50:08,781 --> 00:50:11,253
The muscles in her face
don't even move right.

956
00:50:11,577 --> 00:50:12,999
How's the class seem?

957
00:50:13,946 --> 00:50:15,500
Like it didn't really happen.

958
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,893
They're still processing.

959
00:50:16,952 --> 00:50:19,275
I know it doesn't seem so,
but they are.

960
00:50:20,345 --> 00:50:22,266
What about Laetitia?
What happens to her?

961
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,341
Nothing worse
than she's already seen.

962
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,261
She'll probably go
to a juvenile facility,

963
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:28,878
which is only a little worse
than her group home.

964
00:50:28,997 --> 00:50:30,280
She was in a group home?

965
00:50:30,379 --> 00:50:31,764
She grew up in the system.

966
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,493
Monday-to-Friday angry.

967
00:50:34,104 --> 00:50:37,332
Last year, she was suspended twice,
and then expelled.

968
00:50:37,787 --> 00:50:39,054
Chiquan wasn't positive though,

969
00:50:39,113 --> 00:50:40,998
if you're looking for
a silver lining and all.

970
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,417
Excuse me?

971
00:50:42,437 --> 00:50:44,930
She didn't have HIV,
in case you were worrying.

972
00:50:51,008 --> 00:50:53,137
Marcus.
Boy, what are you trying to do?

973
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,795
You trying to get knocked out?

974
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,522
Drop your head, son.

975
00:50:56,831 --> 00:50:58,861
Left up! Get that left up!

976
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,819
Pick your hand up, damn.

977
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:04,139
Man, that boy listen to anyone?

978
00:51:06,975 --> 00:51:08,895
All right, all right.
Time, time.

979
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:11,412
Not bad, y'all.
Not bad, Justin.

980
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,628
Marcus, you got
to concentrate, man, think.

981
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:15,997
All right?

982
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:19,803
Listen,
I got tickets to the fights tonight.

983
00:51:20,298 --> 00:51:21,339
Pikesville armory.

984
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,444
Now, I was gonna
take Justin and Spider,

985
00:51:23,508 --> 00:51:24,956
but Spider ain't
been hanging out,

986
00:51:24,996 --> 00:51:27,150
and Marcus, I know you
got your mother, right?

987
00:51:27,211 --> 00:51:28,674
So, Michael...

988
00:51:29,598 --> 00:51:30,981
you want to see the fights?

989
00:51:32,775 --> 00:51:33,823
You going?

990
00:51:34,304 --> 00:51:35,588
Yeah, I'm in.

991
00:51:38,425 --> 00:51:39,708
Yeah, all right.

992
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:42,471
All right.
Come on, get this headgear off.

993
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,643
What the fuck is that?

994
00:51:54,092 --> 00:51:55,218
Souvenir.

995
00:51:56,269 --> 00:51:57,297
What?

996
00:51:59,729 --> 00:52:01,427
Trouble with doing it this way?

997
00:52:01,506 --> 00:52:03,055
Disappearing 'em and shit?

998
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:04,554
Nobody knows.

999
00:52:09,524 --> 00:52:11,184
I remember when I was a kid,

1000
00:52:13,111 --> 00:52:15,205
If you had a map of the world,

1001
00:52:15,861 --> 00:52:19,222
the playground over at Baker and
Moreland would be at the center of it.

1002
00:52:21,216 --> 00:52:22,287
And as I got older,

1003
00:52:22,578 --> 00:52:25,153
the playground just
kept on getting bigger,

1004
00:52:25,364 --> 00:52:26,946
went beyond the neighborhood.

1005
00:52:30,058 --> 00:52:31,758
Everything changes, you know?

1006
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:35,389
One minute the ice cream truck
be the only thing you want to hear.

1007
00:52:44,872 --> 00:52:47,244
Next thing, them touts calling
out the her-on

1008
00:52:47,323 --> 00:52:48,846
be the only thing you can hear.

1009
00:52:59,255 --> 00:53:00,402
What's that?

1010
00:53:01,756 --> 00:53:03,483
Workbook I need to use with this.

1011
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:13,521
So, you read from the small one
and answer questions in the big one?

1012
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:15,681
Yeah, ain't no thing.

1013
00:53:26,928 --> 00:53:27,996
Yeah, I see that.

1014
00:53:40,881 --> 00:53:41,969
I see that.

1015
00:54:06,188 --> 00:54:08,409
All right, you see how
he keeping his hands up?

1016
00:54:08,644 --> 00:54:10,809
Look at his feet.
Look at the feet.

1017
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:12,706
See how he's keeping
his feet moving?

1018
00:54:15,256 --> 00:54:16,475
See what I'm saying?

1019
00:54:16,612 --> 00:54:18,370
See? See how he stay in close?

1020
00:54:19,152 --> 00:54:21,070
That's how you take away his power.

1021
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,146
Yo, dude is cut.

1022
00:54:23,422 --> 00:54:24,619
Yeah, man.

1023
00:54:24,698 --> 00:54:26,174
That's discipline.

1024
00:54:26,386 --> 00:54:29,107
You take care your body,
your body take care of you.

1025
00:54:31,972 --> 00:54:34,474
Yo, I bet his woman is fine, man.

1026
00:54:34,755 --> 00:54:36,514
Yeah, I bet she is, too.

1027
00:54:41,609 --> 00:54:42,873
Flush to the queen.

1028
00:54:45,757 --> 00:54:46,872
Full house.

1029
00:54:50,576 --> 00:54:52,738
All right, everybody,
Let me see them hands, y'all.

1030
00:54:52,973 --> 00:54:54,072
Hands.

1031
00:54:54,302 --> 00:54:55,671
Hey, yo, big man, back up.

1032
00:54:57,104 --> 00:54:58,409
I don't know about cards,

1033
00:54:58,508 --> 00:55:00,972
but, I think these 45s
beat a full house.

1034
00:55:01,316 --> 00:55:03,037
Hey, yo, banker,
cash me out, yo.

1035
00:55:05,524 --> 00:55:07,975
Boy, you want a head on
that body, you best hop to.

1036
00:55:10,195 --> 00:55:11,342
That's my money.

1037
00:55:13,279 --> 00:55:15,137
Man, money ain't got no owners,

1038
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,806
only spenders.

1039
00:55:17,222 --> 00:55:20,003
I tell you something else--
I like that ring, too.

1040
00:55:24,226 --> 00:55:26,795
Boy, you got me confused
with a man repeats himself.

1041
00:55:39,843 --> 00:55:40,701
This ain't over.

1042
00:55:40,944 --> 00:55:42,723
Oh, that's how you
carrying it, shorty?

1043
00:55:43,915 --> 00:55:46,087
'Cause,
I can find your peoples

1044
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:48,333
a whole lot easier
than they can find me.

1045
00:55:51,524 --> 00:55:52,690
Wear it in health.

1046
00:55:55,357 --> 00:55:56,424
No doubt.

1047
00:56:09,788 --> 00:56:11,368
You see what I'm talking about, Justin?

1048
00:56:11,447 --> 00:56:13,463
That's what I'm saying.
That's the real deal.

1049
00:56:13,713 --> 00:56:16,829
You keep training, I'm telling you, boy,
You can get there.

1050
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,964
See, the last fight
was the best.

1051
00:56:19,191 --> 00:56:20,939
The Puerto Rican boy
had a good left.

1052
00:56:21,038 --> 00:56:22,490
Yeah, shit was tight.

1053
00:56:22,959 --> 00:56:24,796
Oh, this is it,
right here on the right.

1054
00:56:24,997 --> 00:56:26,024
All right.

1055
00:56:28,229 --> 00:56:30,564
- All right now.
- All right, I see you tomorrow, coach.

1056
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:44,444
All right, now,
so you live over on--

1057
00:56:45,096 --> 00:56:46,626
Hey, hey, boy, what you doing?

1058
00:56:46,693 --> 00:56:47,995
I'm gonna take you home.

1059
00:56:48,094 --> 00:56:49,074
No, no, thank you.

1060
00:56:49,093 --> 00:56:51,893
Michael, come on now.
Serious.

1061
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,216
Nah, no thank you.
I'm good from here.

1062
00:57:32,652 --> 00:57:36,641
