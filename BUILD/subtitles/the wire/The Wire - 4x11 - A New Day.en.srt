1
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,098
Uh, yeah... can I get the
mixed vegetables and white rice?

2
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:28,560
- OK, mixed vegetables, white rice.
- Damn, dook.

3
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,435
You actin' like this
some fancy ass spot.

4
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:32,051
It ain't nothing
but a chink joint.

5
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:33,192
I'm-a order.

6
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,874
Then do it,
I said I got it.

7
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:40,660
Look at this nigga flashin' his shit

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,337
like some big-time gangster.

9
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:43,887
Yeah, Nay, a righteous hustler.

10
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:45,723
I'm just treating y'all, that's all.

11
00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:48,047
You know I like to keep it real
with the little people.

12
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:49,389
Man, fuck you, man.

13
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,171
I was talking about you.

14
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,313
Can I order the yakame
with turkey grease?

15
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:02,098
Yakame, noodles--

16
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:03,667
This nigga
ordered turkey grease.

17
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:06,331
What's wrong, yo?
I mean, my mom, she get it all the time.

18
00:01:06,412 --> 00:01:08,846
Yo, you is really
one of them at risk children.

19
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:11,330
- You know that, Dukie?
- Yo, man, come on, son.

20
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:12,712
Yeah, I got it. How much?

21
00:01:12,752 --> 00:01:13,971
- $4.00
- Why is it so funny?

22
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,023
He just goofin' on you.

23
00:01:15,043 --> 00:01:16,405
What's wrong with ordering yakame?

24
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:17,838
Nothing wrong with ordering yakame.

25
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,342
It's just the turkey grease that
makes the drunks, You know,

26
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:22,346
throw up all that liquor
they were drinking,

27
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:23,940
go back to swilling that shit.

28
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:28,785
Man, this shit is good.

29
00:01:28,825 --> 00:01:30,107
Why don't you buy your own food?

30
00:01:30,147 --> 00:01:32,412
This is all you getting.
Don't ask for no more of that.

31
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:33,785
That shit tastes good hell.

32
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:37,552
Yo, y'all heard about
what happened to lil' Kevin?

33
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:38,744
What?

34
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:39,886
He be dead.

35
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:41,228
He up in them vacants.

36
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:42,797
Why?

37
00:01:42,857 --> 00:01:44,520
Fucked up somewhere,
I suppose.

38
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,151
What the fuck you little hoppers
doing on my avenue?

39
00:01:50,252 --> 00:01:51,433
- Eating.
- Shit you are.

40
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:53,537
You're probably setting up
to snatch a purse.

41
00:01:54,318 --> 00:01:57,345
Get the fuck back on the reservation
where your black asses belong.

42
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:58,808
How you feeling, little man?

43
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:00,562
Need a hand with that food?

44
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:03,647
I said get.

45
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:12,947
Yo, y'all hear that shit?

46
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,109
"My avenue."

47
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,992
It's just as much ours as it is his.

48
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,214
Walker be evil, yo.

49
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:18,894
He be thieving and
smackin' folk down.

50
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:22,084
We should get him back on
the payback tip for all the dirt he do.

51
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:24,047
You want to throw down with police?

52
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:25,943
I don't mean go at him direct,

53
00:02:25,963 --> 00:02:27,285
but, you know, hurt him.

54
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:29,589
Like, slash his tires
or some shit.

55
00:02:30,428 --> 00:02:32,251
We could stick
condoms on his car.

56
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:35,196
That'd send a message.

57
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:36,599
Yeah, but what kind?

58
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:38,814
We should slap bumper stickers
on his windshield.

59
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,757
I mean,
they is hard to get off.

60
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:42,059
Hold on, wait, wait.

61
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:45,173
Do officer walker
go to that club on Stockton,

62
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,835
the one where
the western police party?

63
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,258
I seen his car there.

64
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:51,247
I got this one.

65
00:02:55,023 --> 00:02:57,647
4x11 A New Day

66
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,380
And as much as I empathize,

67
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,524
I can only tell you
that there is a process

68
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:38,726
for complaints like this one.

69
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:40,822
Don't sell us on process, Mr. Mayor.

70
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:43,666
We've had years of this kind
of treatment from city police.

71
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:46,511
You need to understand
we do this as an affront to the cloth.

72
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:49,237
We've asked
for a civilian review board

73
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:50,379
for decades, now.

74
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,443
Absent that,
how can we trust

75
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:54,827
any investigation
of any complaint?

76
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:56,149
Forgive me, gentlemen,

77
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:57,644
but last I checked,

78
00:04:57,984 --> 00:04:59,603
the department had
a black commissioner

79
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:01,258
and a black I.I.D. director.

80
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,281
The problem is systemic.

81
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:04,904
And as to commissioner Burrell,

82
00:05:04,964 --> 00:05:07,871
we understand that
his authority is now limited.

83
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:10,836
Mr. Mayor, when it comes
to matters like this one,

84
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:14,041
do you expect us to have
faith in deputy Rawls?

85
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:15,359
I expect you'll be good enough

86
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,082
not to prejudge
the department's response

87
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:18,965
before the investigation
even begins,

88
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:20,251
as I won't prejudge it.

89
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:22,176
I can only tell you
that I take this incident

90
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:25,563
very seriously,
and that I will pursue all of the facts.

91
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:30,517
Well, Mr. Mayor,

92
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,220
you said you would have
an open door,

93
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,949
and so far I credit you
for keeping that promise.

94
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:37,092
And my door
will always be open to you.

95
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:38,795
Thank you.

96
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:47,783
If they couldn't get civilian review
in Royce administration,

97
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:49,526
how can they think
they'll get it from me?

98
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:50,728
They're just testing you here,

99
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:53,132
trying to see how vulnerable
you feel on the racial stuff.

100
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,674
On Burrell, too,
for what it's worth.

101
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:56,838
Well, civilian review is a nonstarter.

102
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:58,230
You go now there now,

103
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,995
you'll be bending over
for 4 years for the ministers.

104
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:03,568
So what? I throw them a bone
and fire some idiot cop?

105
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:05,200
By pressing that
the average beat cop's

106
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:07,052
gonna hate my guts,
and I ain't gonna change

107
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:08,936
anything around without
rank-and-file support.

108
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:10,787
You don't fire him,
you're going to piss off

109
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:12,642
most of the black
political infrastructure.

110
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:15,579
Yummy.
My first bowl of shit.

111
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:24,200
Circle that right.

112
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,445
And you press that right there.

113
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:34,245
It's work time.

114
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,573
You guys got work to do?
You write down that data?

115
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:38,713
- Yeah.
- All right.

116
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:43,575
Charlene,
what don't you understand?

117
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:44,636
None of it.

118
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:47,221
OK, let's see if we can
find a way you can get it, OK?

119
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:48,908
What's the diameter?

120
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:50,912
- It's 7.
- Good.

121
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:52,586
OK, what's half of that?

122
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,968
You can't take half of it.

123
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:57,447
OK, let's say you have $10
and you gave half of it to Jasmine.

124
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:58,609
Why I do that?

125
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:01,505
Well, just pretend, OK?

126
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,270
You give her half,
how much does she have?

127
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:05,958
- Duh, 5.
- Good.

128
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:08,242
Now let's say this time
you have $7

129
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,386
and you give her half,
how much does she have?

130
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:11,978
$3.50.

131
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,983
Good, so...

132
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:17,358
Yo, Mr. Prez,

133
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,391
check this out.

134
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:29,850
Why we no pick him up at his casa,

135
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,052
follow him from there?

136
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:32,739
Why, so we can
lose him here again?

137
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:35,368
Papa, nothin' say he got to come back
through this way, you know?

138
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:36,614
What if he take another road...

139
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,728
All right.
We pick him up from his casa tomorrow.

140
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,527
Talk.

141
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:45,550
- Don't pout.
- Omar,

142
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:46,932
I'm tired of this, bro.

143
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:50,960
Lo siento, baby.
Lo siento.

144
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:56,466
Hey, now.

145
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,578
There she blow.

146
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:14,477
All right, then.

147
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:16,250
So we agree staring down

148
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,694
a stick-up boy on a corner
takes courage,

149
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:21,312
and we agree it takes courage
to go overnight

150
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:22,708
to Cheltenham or Hickey.

151
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:24,327
This is a good list,

152
00:08:24,557 --> 00:08:26,180
but are there any examples
we can make

153
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,923
outside of being on a corner?

154
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:30,945
I need a volunteer.

155
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:33,573
Not me.

156
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:35,236
What about you, Albert?

157
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:37,069
No.

158
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:38,852
You volunteer
and you don't know what for,

159
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:40,094
you ain't got brains.

160
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:43,438
All right, then.
I need a volunteer to stand on this box

161
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,494
blindfolded, fall off,
and let us catch him

162
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:47,673
before he hits the ground.

163
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:52,769
- Albert?
- That's fucking stupid.

164
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:55,313
What about you, Namond?

165
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:57,016
Wait, wait,
let me get this right.

166
00:08:57,256 --> 00:08:59,208
So you want me to stand up
on that box,

167
00:08:59,229 --> 00:09:01,332
put a blindfold on, fall,

168
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:03,698
and expect these
weak-ass clowns to catch me?

169
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,062
Hell, no.

170
00:09:07,124 --> 00:09:08,125
Who you talkin' to?

171
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:09,207
For real.

172
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:11,331
Yeah, for real.

173
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:13,859
Hey, yo, y'all drop me,
and we gonna have more than words.

174
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:16,928
A'ight.

175
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:18,857
All right, everybody, gather around.

176
00:09:23,673 --> 00:09:24,855
Oh, shit.

177
00:09:26,477 --> 00:09:29,181
You ready? On 3.

178
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:32,667
1, 2, 3.

179
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,304
Shit!
Oh, that St. was right.

180
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:40,167
All right, who wants to go next?

181
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,375
Albert?

182
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:43,319
I ain't doing no
stupid shit like that.

183
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:45,162
Fuck you, and fuck all
y'all bitches.

184
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:53,605
We don't like your ass anyway.

185
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,348
Settle down,
settle down.

186
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,094
Yo, today's specials
are those little hershey bars,

187
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:04,600
3 for a dime, and I got all your
your other favorites, too.

188
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,537
Yo, Deante,
I got your licorice--

189
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:07,919
red and black both.

190
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,602
Snitchin' Randy.

191
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:30,237
Well, I' be blessed, yo.
Look it.

192
00:10:30,347 --> 00:10:31,789
This is good?
We put him here?

193
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:33,813
That tall man with prop Joe?

194
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:36,270
Yo, for real,
on this caper,

195
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:38,434
the more we learn,
the less we know.

196
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,616
We can go?

197
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:40,815
No, we stay.

198
00:10:41,536 --> 00:10:42,899
Papa, I need to go.

199
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,742
I say we stay, Renaldo.
What's wrong, yo?

200
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:45,944
No, no, I mean go.

201
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:49,328
We been in the car
too many hours.

202
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:52,474
Whether you squat in an alley
or sittin' on a porcelain throne,

203
00:10:52,742 --> 00:10:55,066
don't really change
the moment, now do it?

204
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,403
Rough day?

205
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:02,936
Doesn't help to hold it in.

206
00:11:04,058 --> 00:11:05,560
What the fuck you know?

207
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:10,382
If you tell me,
maybe we can help.

208
00:11:13,602 --> 00:11:14,824
Ain't nothing.

209
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:18,393
Look, come on, Albert,
you been doing real good

210
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:21,097
in this class,
real good till today.

211
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,493
Just give it a try.

212
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,655
I went home yesterday,
my mom's on the couch.

213
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:40,344
She dead.

214
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:44,290
Me-Maw said best not come
to school, but...

215
00:11:49,913 --> 00:11:51,876
Yeah, you want to be with your mom.

216
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:55,949
Of course you did.

217
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,943
Some of you know me
from narcotics work,

218
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:02,668
some from earlier if you
worked the western district,

219
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,695
and some of you I'm meeting
for the first time,

220
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,933
but the only point I'd
really like to make here today

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,880
is that this is a transitional time

222
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,304
for this department
and for the city as a whole.

223
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,456
We have a new mayor
and a new state's attorney,

224
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:16,181
and they both feel like
they have a mandate for change.

225
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,775
The point is that given
the Mayor's position on crime

226
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,598
and given the outcome of the election,

227
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:25,080
we can expect certain enhancements.

228
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,122
Oh, really?

229
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,224
Certain improvements...

230
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:29,207
may be forthcoming
in the near future.

231
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:31,030
So we're looking
for feedback here,

232
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,250
some input as to what we need

233
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,634
more of or less of
to better work murders.

234
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,896
Better witness protection.

235
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:37,591
More proactive investigation.

236
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:38,693
Pay raise.

237
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:41,798
Better lab work.

238
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:43,461
- More techs on duty.
- More overtime.

239
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:44,683
More scotch!

240
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:47,409
More time for case pp.
Seriously.

241
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:48,892
More women.
Loose women.

242
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:51,296
Pay hike, double-Digits.

243
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,154
Mo' better,
mo' better, mo' better.

244
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,743
That's what we need.

245
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:00,388
Sounds like a new day, don't it?

246
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,571
Department's finally gonna
get what it needs.

247
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,294
State's attorney's office, too.

248
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,272
A new day.

249
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:08,776
They make a nice couple, anyway.

250
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,000
Looking forward to working with you.

251
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:15,352
hat's signed by
a now inaugurated Mayor

252
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:18,998
ordering his police commanders
to avoid mass arrests.

253
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,336
Community based policing,

254
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:22,560
and high-end enforcements
are to be emphasized.

255
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,142
I take it Burrell got a copy.

256
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:25,272
In person.

257
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:27,275
I don't see it.

258
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:29,414
Why not just fire the fucking asshole?

259
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:31,077
The mayor is weighing his options.

260
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:32,339
What the fuck does that mean?

261
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,062
To fire Burrell,
we're going to need more

262
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:36,456
political capital
than we have right now.

263
00:13:36,676 --> 00:13:39,941
Speaking of which,
it brings us to another

264
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,384
little piece of business.

265
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:44,118
- The thing with the minister.
- It's a delicate situation.

266
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:46,502
The ministers are pressing
for a civilian review,

267
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:48,707
which I know the rank-and-file
don't want to hear,

268
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:51,311
but it speaks directly
to the situation with Burrell.

269
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,688
If we expend capital
defending this incident--

270
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:56,132
I get it.
You want the cop fired.

271
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,016
No, we're not saying that at all.

272
00:13:58,076 --> 00:14:01,730
The mayor doesn't want to interfere with
the everyday workings of the department.

273
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:04,755
But it's a balancing act.

274
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:08,166
Our response has to be smart
and evenhanded,

275
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:09,929
in a racial sense especially.

276
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:11,972
If I'm hearing you,
it's about perception.

277
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:13,259
Exactly.

278
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:17,664
I.I.D. Has a black commander,
but he's beholden to Burrell.

279
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:19,868
He'll stir shit with this if he can.

280
00:14:22,836 --> 00:14:25,641
The sergeant in question
is assigned to C.I.D.

281
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:27,624
His new commander is Daniels.

282
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:30,589
He's smart, he's black,
and politically neutral.

283
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:33,003
That work for you?

284
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,165
Works for us.

285
00:14:44,461 --> 00:14:46,985
Who that?
I said, who's that?

286
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,051
You home, or you just visiting?

287
00:14:58,492 --> 00:14:59,671
Home if I can.

288
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,613
All right.
Get by the fire if you want.

289
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:09,695
I got a couple of dogs left,

290
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:10,716
you hungry?

291
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:20,164
Shit weren't working out with
Jo-Jo and them.

292
00:15:20,224 --> 00:15:22,728
Said I owed him some cheddar or
some shit some other boy did.

293
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:24,638
I don't want to make no
noise on that, though.

294
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:25,946
They pressin' you.

295
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,102
You know...

296
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,123
get with me,
and we pay 'em right back, OK?

297
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:35,688
No, all that shit you been sayin' to me
goin' through my head.

298
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,393
Forget about that.
Forget about all that.

299
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:38,795
If I wouldn't have pushed you off,

300
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:40,332
you'd have never
been on that corner.

301
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,171
But everything I do I be fucking up.

302
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:44,475
Whole time it feel like it
wasn't me on that corner.

303
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:45,897
I just wanted to get away.

304
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,969
Well, you're here now,
ain't you? Right?

305
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:55,034
This is you, right here,
right now, OK?

306
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,003
You're burning a hole in
that shirt, man.

307
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,265
Fuck-- You fucked me all up when

308
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:03,107
I saw you walking through
the door, Sherrod.

309
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:04,550
Shit!

310
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:06,243
What you think, huh?

311
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,889
You know, I get
half price for this.

312
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:09,915
All right,
take your hat off, man.

313
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:11,942
Don't burn them pimp steaks, huh?

314
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:23,841
Took long enough.

315
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,477
Yo, Dukie,
you sure about this?

316
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:34,237
I mean,
I'm with y'all.

317
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,833
Y'all my boys like that.

318
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:38,407
Y'all there for me,
I'm there for y'all.

319
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,566
I'm really starting to think
this is some fucked-up shit.

320
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:44,231
I mean, Officer Walker's
a shady motherfucker,

321
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,075
but he's police.

322
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,886
We do it Michael's way,
we send a message.

323
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,850
You ain't got to do what I got to do.

324
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,643
We drew straws, nay.

325
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:19,314
Let's go.

326
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:29,675
This is everything?

327
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,779
Sergeant Hauk's statement,
the ministers',

328
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:34,488
statements of the other officers,
it's all there.

329
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:36,131
No independent witnesses, huh?

330
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:38,915
It's a lot of smoke, but
I'm not feeling much in the way of fire.

331
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:40,598
It was a strong case
for discourtesy.

332
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:43,742
True, but no indication
of racial or religious overtones.

333
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:46,106
And the brutality allegation
is a stretch.

334
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:49,358
I've gone over GOC/7.

335
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:51,402
I'm up to speed with the matrix,

336
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,986
but since the buck stops
with me on this one,

337
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:55,672
walk me through my options.

338
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,937
Minor offenses,
you can issue a summary judgme--

339
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,162
A period of extra duty without pay,

340
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:04,128
guidance and counseling, the like,

341
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:06,372
or if Sergeant Hauk
fights your decision

342
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:08,285
or if there's a more
substantive charge,

343
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:09,817
it goes downstairs to a trial board.

344
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:11,039
And possible termination?

345
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:17,877
Let me ask you...

346
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,742
if the minister's connected,

347
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:23,004
and if all eyes are on this one,

348
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,738
what does command want to see happen?

349
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:27,401
What does city hall want
to see happen?

350
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:30,166
City hall just wants
someone to do the right thing,

351
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:31,826
whatever that is.

352
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:35,157
You're sitting here, Deputy,
telling me to just do the right thing?

353
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:36,980
Doesn't happen often, I know.

354
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:04,451
Hey! What are you doing?
Come here!

355
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:09,580
You motherfucker,
when I get your little ass...

356
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:14,802
Come on,
show me hands, bitch.

357
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:17,827
Back the fuck,
little hopper, I'm police.

358
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:21,188
Yeah, I know, you the police who like
To fuck with a nigger. Turn around.

359
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:26,242
You ain't gonna hear the next one.

360
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:28,456
Get on your knees,
cross them legs,

361
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:30,004
knit them hand come on.

362
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,729
Ooh, hold on.

363
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:38,416
Yo, what the fuck you doing?

364
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:40,546
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

365
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:42,509
Give up that ring, man.

366
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:44,877
Come on.

367
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:48,149
Yeah.

368
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:58,377
Payback.

369
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,402
That's right, run, motherfuckers!

370
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:04,175
Shit!

371
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:19,489
I'm telling you, right there.

372
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:22,194
This horse is a winner,
look at it, OK?

373
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:23,440
How you doing?

374
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:24,969
Excuse me.

375
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:26,778
Mr. Mayor.

376
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:29,326
On my way downtown today
I saw an abandoned car.

377
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:30,435
Tow it right away.

378
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,079
Where is--
Mr. Mayor, the location.

379
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:36,148
Fucking Christ.
Call transpo!

380
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,550
Get the fucking trucks moving!

381
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,982
- Mr. Mayor.
- I got a constituent call.

382
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:47,587
She said the playground
near her house

383
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,370
was a hazard.
Rusted metal.

384
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,529
We'll get right on it.

385
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:53,272
The location?
Sir, I need a location.

386
00:20:54,074 --> 00:20:57,441
Mr. Mayor, I understand your concern,
but you've got to understand,

387
00:20:57,621 --> 00:20:59,880
we have more than 9,100 hydrants.

388
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:01,204
And one of them's leaking.

389
00:21:03,456 --> 00:21:04,721
Sensitivity counseling,

390
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:08,320
2 week's extra duty,
no punishment past that.

391
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:10,570
They sliced it into the rough.

392
00:21:11,132 --> 00:21:14,170
Does Daniels know the bind
this puts his boy Carcetti in?

393
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:17,249
Well, Wilson briefed Rawls,
Rawls briefed Daniels.

394
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:20,718
It's Carcetti doing Pontius Pilate,

395
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:23,283
putting it on Daniels,
who was a safe choice

396
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:25,223
as far as the rank-and-file goes.

397
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,025
But that won't be enough
for the ministers,

398
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,387
not by a long shot.

399
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:37,458
Am I the only one that knows
how to play this game?

400
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:43,789
Let's go, get that hydrant sealed.

401
00:22:19,257 --> 00:22:22,923
3 of them with shotguns got me
coming outside the club.

402
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:24,701
I made 'em for bloods.

403
00:22:25,018 --> 00:22:27,943
The paint's supposed to be some
kind of declaration of war.

404
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:29,840
Sounds like we get to stomp some ass.

405
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,162
The western district way.

406
00:22:35,072 --> 00:22:37,175
Yellow paint
a declaration of war?

407
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:39,763
That's a new one.

408
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:48,664
So what I heard was
that this wild-ass boys--

409
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:51,720
I ain't saying no names--
but they past crazy.

410
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,085
They robbed him.

411
00:22:53,134 --> 00:22:55,478
They threw paint on his ass,
yellow paint.

412
00:22:56,044 --> 00:22:57,386
Shit, I ain't lying.

413
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:59,637
Well, I don't know about that,

414
00:22:59,717 --> 00:23:02,161
but you showed me something
getting on that box like that.

415
00:23:02,322 --> 00:23:03,384
That wasn't nothing.

416
00:23:03,491 --> 00:23:04,890
No, don't sell yourself short.

417
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:07,768
Ms. Duquette, Mr. Parenti,
we all thought it took courage.

418
00:23:07,997 --> 00:23:09,935
Especially considering
how y'all do each other.

419
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,050
You think?

420
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,452
Yeah.

421
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,515
Now, look, you're showing
a lot of progress in class.

422
00:23:16,676 --> 00:23:18,050
I mean, you know that, don't you?

423
00:23:18,117 --> 00:23:20,557
You know, you're doing the work.
You're not acting out.

424
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:23,180
It's getting to the point where

425
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,433
you can go back to regular
class, no problem.

426
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:26,835
Back to gen-pop?

427
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,405
You want me to go?

428
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:31,071
Well, if you're ready.

429
00:23:34,464 --> 00:23:35,927
I ain't going back there.

430
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,302
Why not?

431
00:23:38,073 --> 00:23:39,976
Shit they teach there be deadly,

432
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,466
but I know you know that, Bunny.

433
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:47,306
All right, all right!
All right, all right!

434
00:23:47,663 --> 00:23:49,670
We can squeeze a little money
from here and there

435
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:51,710
but nothing on the scale
for what you're asking.

436
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,543
Maybe free up some operating money

437
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:55,830
by shifting some of these
pay-go projects

438
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,252
into the capital program.

439
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,997
I can steal a little from
the budget stabilization fund,

440
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:03,460
but we still got
to absorb 120 grant positions

441
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,478
in the police department,
mostly officers.

442
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:08,459
- Christ, don't let those go unfunded.
- A lot of balls in the air,

443
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:10,272
and I still haven't seen
the schools' budget.

444
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:12,075
What about the revenue surplus?

445
00:24:12,142 --> 00:24:13,894
As I said, that's one-time money.

446
00:24:13,975 --> 00:24:16,272
I'm going to give the police
a 5% raise, that's forever.

447
00:24:16,312 --> 00:24:19,422
If I'm gonna ask the police department
to get up on its hind legs and fight,

448
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:22,499
I got to throw some money. You're
telling me how I can't do, not how I can.

449
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,742
There's the rainy day fund,
but you really shouldn't draw that down.

450
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:29,260
The bond rating houses want at least 5%
of the budget in reserve.

451
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,922
Feels like a rainy day to me.

452
00:24:31,064 --> 00:24:32,667
Cloudy like a motherfucker.

453
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:35,919
Yo, yo, wait up, yo.

454
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,782
Hey, yo.
Check it.

455
00:24:48,043 --> 00:24:49,826
- Fuck is up with y'all?
- Ain't you, Mike.

456
00:24:49,866 --> 00:24:51,849
We wanna have a word
with your boy, here.

457
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:54,744
Ain't nothing stopping you. Talk.

458
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:56,026
You know what we mean.

459
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,689
The little bitch been talking to police.

460
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,291
That's a lie.
I ain't do no snitching.

461
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:02,015
The fuck you ain't.
Peeing hisself right now, man.

462
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:05,878
You ain't gonna stand by
no rat motherfucker, is you?

463
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,805
Naw, I ain't standing with no rat.

464
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:30,975
These here be them 18-Hour junks.

465
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:32,805
Go to bed, wake up,
still be hot.

466
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,989
Man, feel this one from 3 hours ago.

467
00:25:36,766 --> 00:25:38,423
See what I'm saying, two for one?

468
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,515
Each pack come with two pads.
Buy 5, I give you 6.

469
00:25:41,745 --> 00:25:43,047
Gimme 6 then.

470
00:25:43,094 --> 00:25:44,133
$5?

471
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,308
A piece.

472
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:47,305
Obliged, sir, obliged.

473
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:49,058
Take this side,
I'll take this side.

474
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:51,963
Bubbles depot.

475
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:53,706
Bubbles depot got what you need,

476
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:56,130
ya'll come see.
Come see me.

477
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:58,511
Oh, lookie, lookie--
Hey, Sherrod!

478
00:26:01,215 --> 00:26:02,417
What up?

479
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,225
Car must've hit it or some shit.

480
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:08,711
- How much you think?
- Aluminum?

481
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:10,954
Aluminum about 30,
40 cents a pound.

482
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:13,797
We've got a benjamin here easy, baby.

483
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:20,399
Teamwork payin' off today,
ain't it, baby?

484
00:26:20,518 --> 00:26:22,061
Go get the heavy side.
Let me try it.

485
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:27,727
Get out of the way!

486
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:29,971
That's enough!

487
00:26:31,954 --> 00:26:33,159
Get out of here!

488
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:35,164
That's enough! Break it up!

489
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:36,507
Hey, Randy, you bitch.

490
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:38,510
We ain't even done
with your snitchin' ass.

491
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:43,431
Guess them books
are good for something.

492
00:26:47,896 --> 00:26:49,459
Somebody call the nurse.

493
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,943
Yo, why they banged me?

494
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,819
I ain't no snitch.

495
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:55,876
Randy, Randy, it's OK.

496
00:27:03,396 --> 00:27:04,798
Thanks a lot.

497
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,776
Health department shut
Chicken George again?

498
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,319
No, I had to duck in here for cover.

499
00:27:13,385 --> 00:27:14,924
Your boys off the hook today.

500
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:28,598
Not a good day to be
cross-eyed in west Baltimore.

501
00:27:28,658 --> 00:27:30,982
- What, y'all behind on your
quotas or some shit?

502
00:27:31,142 --> 00:27:32,464
What the fuck?

503
00:27:33,843 --> 00:27:35,606
Seems one of my side
got jumped last night.

504
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:37,609
Yeah, Walker.
I heard about that shit.

505
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:39,173
Threw paint on him.

506
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:45,156
Walker's an asshole.

507
00:27:48,178 --> 00:27:49,791
Hey, you play in dirt,
you get dirty.

508
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:52,115
<i>7-Adam-14, do you copy?</i>

509
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:54,968
Go ahead, K.G.A.

510
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,932
<i>Report of a burglary 19 north Monroe.</i>

511
00:27:58,998 --> 00:28:00,046
Copy.

512
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:04,500
We should do this again.

513
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:07,946
Don't go making any furtive moves.

514
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:09,014
No doubt.

515
00:28:09,074 --> 00:28:10,316
Don't break a pencil point.

516
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,455
Mr. P., I swear I only told
the police what everybody knows.

517
00:28:25,142 --> 00:28:26,684
Does that make me a snitch, Michael?

518
00:28:26,784 --> 00:28:28,707
Shouldn't oughta told nobody nothing.

519
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:31,255
But that don't make you a snitch.

520
00:28:31,315 --> 00:28:32,554
Not if you ain't put nobody in.

521
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:34,642
Jesus.
I should have stopped this.

522
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:36,063
It ain't your fault, Mr. P.

523
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:39,339
I mean, all this come up because of what
Tiffany said happened in the bathroom.

524
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:41,503
What did you tell them, Randy?
What do they know?

525
00:28:41,584 --> 00:28:44,042
I just told them about
Lex going up to the playground

526
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:46,512
behind Fulton,
and how everybody said he got killed

527
00:28:46,572 --> 00:28:48,349
and put in one of
them boarded up houses.

528
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:49,434
That's all you told them?

529
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:52,484
I mean, they wanted me
to say that I was there, but...

530
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:56,346
I just told them
that Little Kevin told me.

531
00:28:56,386 --> 00:28:57,994
- Little Kevin?
- He killed, too.

532
00:28:58,332 --> 00:29:01,494
I mean, Marlo got him, too.
That's what everybody saying, anyway.

533
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:03,494
Marlo Stanfield?

534
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,842
I heard Kevin got
locked up just last week.

535
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:09,946
Now he's supposed to be up
in the house somewhere.

536
00:29:09,986 --> 00:29:11,706
They put him in a vacant, too, huh?

537
00:29:13,993 --> 00:29:17,962
OK, Randy, for now,
I want to say Michael's right.

538
00:29:18,102 --> 00:29:20,025
If anyone tries to talk to you again,

539
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:23,233
say nothing to anyone, understand?

540
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:25,196
Will that make it better?

541
00:29:28,354 --> 00:29:31,019
So in sum, gentlemen,
the gods have spoken.

542
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,084
No longer do we live
and die by stats.

543
00:29:34,445 --> 00:29:36,949
From this day forward
we are about quality arrests,

544
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:39,016
felonies, serious misdemeanors,

545
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:42,127
the back-to-basics police work
of our sainted fathers.

546
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,911
Still, the truth is it would be easier

547
00:29:43,978 --> 00:29:46,261
to turn an oil tanker around
in a puddle.

548
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,534
Our people were raised on stats.

549
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:52,526
If you can't bend patrol
to the mission, Eugene,

550
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:55,109
I'll damn sure find someone who can.

551
00:29:56,985 --> 00:29:58,067
Gentlemen.

552
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:02,548
Sir.

553
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:07,972
Along the line of what you propose,

554
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:10,196
I'd like to reconstitute
the major crimes unit,

555
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:11,925
bring it under
the umbrella of homicide.

556
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:14,887
And let me guess, you'd like
to shake up the personnel.

557
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:16,149
Where appropriate.

558
00:30:19,205 --> 00:30:20,417
Go for it, Colonel.

559
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:29,956
- What?
- Smart move, accepting any ideas

560
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:32,446
whatsoever come from
the anointed fella.

561
00:30:33,822 --> 00:30:35,705
Daniels.
The next commissioner.

562
00:30:35,905 --> 00:30:38,003
Any cocksucker that
manages to go from

563
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,989
Lieutenant to full bird in
a little more than a year

564
00:30:42,156 --> 00:30:43,438
is getting groomed.

565
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,765
Wait...
you didn't for a minute think that--

566
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:52,213
Ah, Jesus, Bill,
it's Baltimore.

567
00:30:52,526 --> 00:30:54,817
You ain't one
of the natives, are ya?

568
00:31:09,607 --> 00:31:10,937
You see where they went?

569
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:14,423
El gordo and tall man,
they go in a big room.

570
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,667
First floor.

571
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:17,620
Sign outside say "new day coop".

572
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,966
Coop?
What's a coop?

573
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:24,254
New day coop.
That's what it say.

574
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,614
Hey, yo, was there like a bar
between the 2 "os"?

575
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:28,917
Si, exactly.

576
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,122
Yeah, that's co-op.

577
00:31:31,495 --> 00:31:32,977
Prop Joe in a co-op?

578
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:35,021
Joe go in with the man we robbed.

579
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,645
Remember, he fell down on his knees,

580
00:31:37,906 --> 00:31:39,144
wept like a little baby.

581
00:31:39,204 --> 00:31:41,708
Yeah, fat face Ricky.
Anybody else?

582
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,364
Si, como 8 or 9 others
I never see before,

583
00:31:46,952 --> 00:31:48,534
but all the same to me, you know?

584
00:31:48,738 --> 00:31:50,120
Narcotraficantes.

585
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,623
Prop Joe sat down to the table.

586
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:59,099
Oh, do tell.
The worm done came full circle.

587
00:32:01,282 --> 00:32:02,322
Marlo.

588
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:05,026
Que?

589
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:06,569
If that is what I think it is,

590
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:08,548
our little clutch of chickens
might be putting

591
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:10,231
all their eggs up in one basket.

592
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,799
Is good?

593
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:14,404
Muy bueno, baby.

594
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:19,266
Know one thing--
I wouldn't walk around with it

595
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:21,009
on my neck for walker to find.

596
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,491
He ain't gonna find it.

597
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:24,429
You crazy even taking a chance.

598
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,954
If he catch you with it,

599
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:28,065
he gonna break more than them fingers.

600
00:32:30,196 --> 00:32:31,431
Man, what up with you?

601
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:33,567
It's like lately you gone all...

602
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:36,185
like taking off the mask, yo.

603
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:39,110
What up with that?
If walker got a look--

604
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,332
He didn't.

605
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:43,234
What about the thing
with you and Randy?

606
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,358
Everybody now is sayin'
you threw down with him,

607
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:46,900
busted up the boy, dimples, and them.

608
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,194
You wouldn't have stood tall?

609
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,408
That's not what I'm saying.

610
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,752
It's not that you do shit,
it's how you do it.

611
00:32:52,354 --> 00:32:54,904
Yo, look, I'm not trying to stand around

612
00:32:54,971 --> 00:32:57,675
and let no chump-ass niggers
think I'm shook.

613
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,592
I ain't.

614
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:10,835
And?

615
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:13,088
And I want you to sign up.

616
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:22,485
Colonel,
there's the matter of-

617
00:33:22,553 --> 00:33:25,464
You find yourself incompatible
with a certain Lieutenant?

618
00:33:26,148 --> 00:33:27,261
Detective Freamon,

619
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:29,731
you have cart blanche
in picking your squad.

620
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:32,785
In fact, you can pick your
supervisor for all I care.

621
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:45,199
Motherfucker, as far as I'm concerned,
You are the major crimes unit.

622
00:33:46,465 --> 00:33:48,348
It's morning in Baltimore, Lester.

623
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:50,466
Wake up and smell the coffee.

624
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:56,526
Reinforcements?

625
00:33:57,899 --> 00:33:59,421
- Carver.
- Damn, boy,

626
00:33:59,502 --> 00:34:01,104
what brings you back
to the plantation?

627
00:34:01,144 --> 00:34:02,967
I trusted you.
Trusted Daniels.

628
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,624
My fucking mistake, huh?

629
00:34:04,811 --> 00:34:05,863
Hold up.
What's wrong?

630
00:34:05,883 --> 00:34:08,707
The kid you were supposed to protect.
You put his name on the street.

631
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:10,801
They were beating him in front
of the school today,

632
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,063
stomping on him for snitching.

633
00:34:12,103 --> 00:34:13,702
- He all right?
- It's always the same.

634
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:15,285
I should have fucking seen this coming.

635
00:34:15,325 --> 00:34:17,088
I swear to you,
I don't know what happened.

636
00:34:17,108 --> 00:34:18,914
I hooked the kid into
Bunk Moreland and Herc.

637
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:20,137
I can't believe...

638
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,681
where's the kid now?

639
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:23,743
Home.

640
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:26,176
Let me go give this
to the night commander.

641
00:34:26,196 --> 00:34:27,999
We'll park a plainclothes unit
on the house.

642
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,277
You think that makes it better?

643
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,561
We'll be discreet,
set up down the block or some shit.

644
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:34,706
Come on inside. I swear to you--
I'm gonna find out what happened.

645
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:57,617
- Ed bowers.
- Pleasure to meet you.

646
00:35:57,684 --> 00:35:58,820
You surprised us all.

647
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:00,686
- Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
- Thanks.

648
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:02,491
I'd like to introduce you to Dorothy.

649
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:03,753
You heard about Ed Nully?

650
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:06,499
I've heard great things about
what you've been doing, so keep it up.

651
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,605
- I'm delighted you made it, Mr. Mayor.
- Well, it's for a good cause, right?

652
00:36:09,655 --> 00:36:12,341
I am getting the evil eye, however.
I gotta keep him circulating.

653
00:36:12,408 --> 00:36:13,474
- OK.
- This way.

654
00:36:13,514 --> 00:36:14,876
- See you later.
- Take care.

655
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:37,587
The Washington crowd is driving
the local real estate market now,

656
00:36:37,668 --> 00:36:39,090
and if the harbor promenade

657
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,859
could extend to the south branch--

658
00:36:40,925 --> 00:36:42,528
- We're looking at that.
- Should be.

659
00:36:42,595 --> 00:36:44,550
Everything from here
to Hanover street is money.

660
00:36:44,591 --> 00:36:46,333
Mr. Mayor,
play a little poker?

661
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,506
I'm not very lucky.

662
00:36:47,826 --> 00:36:49,168
Luck can change.

663
00:36:49,181 --> 00:36:51,005
Mr. Mayor, I'd like you
to meet Ray Chandler.

664
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:52,588
Pleasure to meet you.

665
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:25,203
Boy, either you gonna do it,
or I'm gonna.

666
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:30,159
There's a reason the police keep
jumping out on you, Nay.

667
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:36,393
So, was it the Bunk's cologne, huh?

668
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,484
Pussy.

669
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,528
I'm gonna miss you, too, bitch.

670
00:37:41,568 --> 00:37:43,511
Lester do love listening
to other people's

671
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:46,096
phone calls, don't you?
A bit of a pervert that way.

672
00:37:46,136 --> 00:37:48,300
You could use a wiretap case or 2.

673
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,642
Broaden your horizons.

674
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:51,024
Oh, no, no.

675
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:54,189
The Bunk is strictly
a suit-and-tie motherfucker.

676
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:57,515
At all hazards,
a man must keep up appearances.

677
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,796
Dignity, I say.
Dignity above all.

678
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:01,098
Governor, hear, hear!

679
00:38:01,218 --> 00:38:03,802
Bunk, you got a minute?

680
00:38:03,903 --> 00:38:06,109
- What's up?
- The Wagstaff kid I sent your way.

681
00:38:06,204 --> 00:38:07,626
Wagstaff?
He one of mine?

682
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,269
Yeah, you were looking
for the boy Lex,

683
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:12,498
shot someone outside a nightclub
a couple-- 3 months back.

684
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,562
This kid knew about
Lex getting killed.

685
00:38:14,822 --> 00:38:15,995
Herc brought him to you.

686
00:38:16,656 --> 00:38:17,718
Herc?

687
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:21,524
This kid is a witness,
and Herc was supposed

688
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:23,267
- to bring him to me?
- That was the plan.

689
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,063
I'm gonna skin that motherfucker.

690
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:30,870
Jesus, Herc.
The fuck did you do?

691
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,770
Something happen to that boy?

692
00:38:35,421 --> 00:38:37,084
Well, young man,
your wish has come true.

693
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:38,947
So this mean I can finally
get out of here?

694
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:41,031
Yes, Monnel,
paperwork was slow coming in

695
00:38:41,098 --> 00:38:43,735
from north avenue,
but you 5 are at the age

696
00:38:43,802 --> 00:38:45,258
where we feel it's to your advantage

697
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:47,201
to join your peers in the ninth grade.

698
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,664
Yo, we in high school!

699
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,055
- When we bump?
- The end of this marking period.

700
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,537
Congratulations.

701
00:38:52,677 --> 00:38:53,979
You're excused.

702
00:38:56,037 --> 00:38:58,862
<i>Mr. Johnson, you have</i>
<i>a visitor in the front office.</i>

703
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,927
<i>Mr. Johnson, please come down</i>
<i>to the front office.</i>

704
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:03,579
Bad news?

705
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,282
Plenty more to go around.

706
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:07,626
They pulled the pin on your program.

707
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:15,448
As I've been saying this week
at every roll call

708
00:39:15,528 --> 00:39:16,627
in every damn district,

709
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,495
if I could scrape together
anymore, I would,

710
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:21,367
but for starters, it's a 5% salary year,
and that's a given.

711
00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:22,969
I know it's not half what you deserve,

712
00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:26,341
but if the revenue estimates stay good,
I promise you'll be seeing more.

713
00:39:29,915 --> 00:39:31,029
Mr. Mayor!

714
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:33,192
My wife thanks you,
my children thank you,

715
00:39:33,272 --> 00:39:34,474
my dog thanks you.

716
00:39:35,098 --> 00:39:37,842
Hey, Sanny, how you able to
tell your wife from your mutt?

717
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:40,106
His wife, she's the one
that's got the fleas.

718
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:43,381
Shit, Bobby, with your old lady,
fleas would be an improvement.

719
00:39:43,502 --> 00:39:45,845
At ease, we got the Mayor here,
gentlemen.

720
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:48,545
When they sit in one place too long
they get a little feisty.

721
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:51,346
I'm not going to stand here
and pretend I know how to do your job.

722
00:39:51,386 --> 00:39:53,029
I don't, but what
I can tell you is that

723
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:56,226
during the past few weeks
I have spoken with many of your peers,

724
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,871
with your union reps,
with the representatives of the F.O.P.,

725
00:39:58,911 --> 00:40:01,015
and the biggest
single complaint I'm hearing

726
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:03,389
concerns the department's
obsession with stats.

727
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:04,851
The fucking numbers game.

728
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:07,275
Well, under my watch
the numbers game is over.

729
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:09,891
You will no longer be under
the gun to meet monthly quotas

730
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:12,616
of ineffective, meaningless
arrests and citations.

731
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:16,741
Excuse me, your worship.

732
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,505
You're not the first person
who stood at the podium making promises.

733
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,709
Jimmy, I'm sure the Mayor
has some pressing business.

734
00:40:21,729 --> 00:40:23,748
No, I'm just saying,
the first community activist

735
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,507
who pitches a bitch about
the corner activity in her neighborhood,

736
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:28,661
aren't we gonna go right back
to rounding up bodies?

737
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:30,912
We need to educate
our citizens to the new approach.

738
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:32,785
They're not the only
ones who need educating.

739
00:40:32,845 --> 00:40:35,690
We got bosses that wouldn't know
police work if it bit 'em in the ass.

740
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:37,251
They been juking stats for years,

741
00:40:37,272 --> 00:40:39,423
and will do it again once
the neighborhoods complain.

742
00:40:39,463 --> 00:40:40,464
It's all they know.

743
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,669
If the old dogs can't get the job done,
I'll find new ones who can.

744
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,194
Look, for years,
I sat on the back bench of the council

745
00:40:48,234 --> 00:40:49,997
and watched our city deteriorate.

746
00:40:50,138 --> 00:40:52,626
It was business as usual
with the same old ideas

747
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:54,369
producing the same old results.

748
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:56,893
Well, I'm here now as you are,
and I'm asking you

749
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:59,248
to put aside your reservations
and give it a go.

750
00:41:03,257 --> 00:41:04,399
All told.

751
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:07,825
You did good.

752
00:41:08,006 --> 00:41:09,749
You got 'em pumped.
They love you.

753
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:13,707
Of course, the wrong decision on
Sergeant Hauk, and who knows?

754
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,670
Carv said the kid had something on it.

755
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:19,892
I talked to him.

756
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:22,316
He had nothing,
just a bunch of hearsay

757
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:23,564
and some shit about zombies.

758
00:41:23,604 --> 00:41:24,926
The boy was to come to me.

759
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:27,196
You know the goddamn G.O.--
it's homicide's call.

760
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:29,652
You don't go putting your paws
in my murder, you simpel fuck.

761
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:31,058
Hey! You're talking to a Sergeant.

762
00:41:31,098 --> 00:41:32,524
Oh, fuck your fucking stripes!

763
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:34,193
Take it easy, Bunk.

764
00:41:34,273 --> 00:41:36,076
Now, Herc is trying to help us, here.

765
00:41:36,136 --> 00:41:37,799
Man, he messed in my murder, he pays.

766
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:40,050
Give him a chance.
We can work something out.

767
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,988
That's easy for you to say.
You ain't the primary on this.

768
00:41:43,389 --> 00:41:44,771
Mother fucker...

769
00:41:48,982 --> 00:41:50,144
What got into him?

770
00:41:51,186 --> 00:41:52,528
He's emotional.

771
00:41:52,628 --> 00:41:54,531
He's been working this case
for a long time.

772
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,489
So the thing right now
is for you to remember

773
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:00,393
everything you did on this case.

774
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:02,289
From the beginning.

775
00:42:13,939 --> 00:42:17,265
He's out there,
hat in hand, literally.

776
00:42:17,374 --> 00:42:19,498
Well, he can wait till hell freezes over.

777
00:42:19,698 --> 00:42:21,841
A Wise man does not burn his bridges

778
00:42:21,881 --> 00:42:24,596
until he first knows
he can part the waters.

779
00:42:25,017 --> 00:42:26,158
Old Ashanti saying.

780
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:28,087
Norman, you grew up in Catonsville.

781
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,261
Show the motherfucker in.

782
00:42:42,895 --> 00:42:44,192
Mr. Mayor,

783
00:42:44,713 --> 00:42:47,448
you know, I don't want to take time
out of your busy schedule.

784
00:42:47,528 --> 00:42:49,857
Look, if this is about me
countermanding your orders

785
00:42:49,923 --> 00:42:51,439
- for more arrests--
- No, sir.

786
00:42:51,496 --> 00:42:54,381
You should proceed as you feel
the situation warrants.

787
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:58,307
Overall policing strategies
may not be my strongest suit.

788
00:42:58,635 --> 00:43:00,738
I'm here about what I do know.

789
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,516
A recommendation from
Sergeant Hauk's Commander

790
00:43:03,636 --> 00:43:05,219
will cross your desk tomorrow.

791
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:07,522
Colonel Daniels,
with Rawls concurring,

792
00:43:07,623 --> 00:43:09,973
recommends sensitivity training.

793
00:43:11,476 --> 00:43:12,879
It may be a fair decision,

794
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:14,842
it may even be the right decision.

795
00:43:15,614 --> 00:43:18,459
But we both know
it won't fly with the ministers,

796
00:43:18,499 --> 00:43:20,402
not even with Daniels behind it.

797
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:31,332
600 pages of rules, regulations,
directives, orders.

798
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:37,662
You fire a white police
for a bad car stop

799
00:43:37,722 --> 00:43:40,948
on a black minister,
you'll lose the rank-and-file.

800
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:44,260
It's not cause enough,
but if a Commander can't find

801
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,878
the grounds
for firing a saint in here...

802
00:43:49,062 --> 00:43:51,806
the man has worked narcotics
for 6 years,

803
00:43:52,468 --> 00:43:56,334
and in narcotics
there are no virgins.

804
00:43:57,136 --> 00:43:59,205
And here in lies your expertise?

805
00:44:00,988 --> 00:44:05,058
I've always been comfortable
delegating strategic elements.

806
00:44:05,198 --> 00:44:06,961
It's what the deputy ops is for.

807
00:44:07,302 --> 00:44:10,649
Me, I know what a Mayor needs.

808
00:44:13,813 --> 00:44:15,356
It was a Chevy Tahoe.

809
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:20,003
License Mike-4-6-0-6-5-4.

810
00:44:20,249 --> 00:44:22,533
And I searched it good,
figuring I'd find some iron,

811
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,143
- but--
- How'd they react?

812
00:44:24,463 --> 00:44:26,487
Chris and Snoop?
They didn't do shit.

813
00:44:26,786 --> 00:44:27,988
Was there anything in the car?

814
00:44:28,004 --> 00:44:30,549
Registration and crap in the glove box,

815
00:44:30,797 --> 00:44:32,960
empty chicken boxes, trash.

816
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,887
They had one of those
plastic milk crates--

817
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:38,370
In the back with some tools in it.

818
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,532
What kind of tools?

819
00:44:39,592 --> 00:44:40,994
I don't know, carpenter tools.

820
00:44:41,295 --> 00:44:42,996
Did you check the crate for weapons?

821
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:45,554
- Nail gun.
- Nail gun?

822
00:44:45,614 --> 00:44:47,457
Yeah, one of them bitches
that shoots nails.

823
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:48,860
They rig it to shoot rounds maybe?

824
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,876
Naw, I shot it.
A nail came out.

825
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:56,401
Look, Lester, seriously,
is any of this helping?

826
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:57,643
Naw, you're doing good.

827
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:02,175
Tell me about jacking Marlo
at the train station.

828
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,434
I'm short 4, right?

829
00:45:14,634 --> 00:45:16,296
Yeah,
I remember your ass.

830
00:45:16,939 --> 00:45:18,962
Here's my 4.
You like that?

831
00:45:19,022 --> 00:45:20,405
- OK!
- I'm gonna beat your ass.

832
00:45:20,465 --> 00:45:21,514
OK, no more!
Stop, stop.

833
00:45:21,554 --> 00:45:23,390
Take the money,
take the money, all right?

834
00:45:25,608 --> 00:45:28,044
Make me work this hard again,
I'm gonna skin one of y'all.

835
00:45:29,654 --> 00:45:30,996
OK. Just go, man.

836
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:36,278
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, man.

837
00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:40,771
You know who got the fattest
asses and the best pussy?

838
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,443
- Who?
- Midgets, nigger.

839
00:45:42,523 --> 00:45:44,887
They're all that,
you know what I'm saying? I got shit--

840
00:45:46,545 --> 00:45:48,709
The fuck happened
to our boy on the door?

841
00:45:48,769 --> 00:45:50,252
Siesta, papa.

842
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:52,937
You fix this, Joe?

843
00:45:58,469 --> 00:45:59,591
What's the problem?

844
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:01,615
Ran out of time.

845
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:04,179
Now, Joe, you've been
so busy being devious,

846
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,572
you done messed around and got
yourself caught up in a web.

847
00:46:06,613 --> 00:46:08,514
Omar, I don't know what
you been hearing, now--

848
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,266
Naw, Joe, ain't no time
for no lies, now.

849
00:46:10,326 --> 00:46:11,989
Now, see, I need you to be straight,

850
00:46:12,029 --> 00:46:14,553
just like you did on that
new day co-op sit down.

851
00:46:14,634 --> 00:46:16,242
Oh, yeah, I know about that.

852
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,125
I knew you the one got Marlo up
in this mess, too.

853
00:46:19,185 --> 00:46:21,208
Hey, Omar, take a deep breath.

854
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:24,736
A Proposition might fall
kindly on your ear.

855
00:46:25,156 --> 00:46:26,919
Well, tickle my fancy, fat man.

856
00:46:27,656 --> 00:46:29,138
Money, drugs, your call.

857
00:46:29,178 --> 00:46:30,901
Come on, now,
you can do better than that.

858
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,824
Hey, we coming at this all wrong.

859
00:46:32,885 --> 00:46:34,969
See, you the one with the high card.

860
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:36,591
You should speak your mind.

861
00:46:38,685 --> 00:46:40,348
You going to serve up Marlo.

862
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,383
You gonna take out Marlo Stanfield?

863
00:46:43,443 --> 00:46:46,429
No, no,
but I got a real powerful urge

864
00:46:46,496 --> 00:46:48,062
to take everything he owns,

865
00:46:48,382 --> 00:46:51,087
and I'm quite confident you
the man can make that happen.

866
00:46:51,127 --> 00:46:52,429
That might take some doing.

867
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:54,387
Naw, naw, see,
we got to have it simple.

868
00:46:54,508 --> 00:46:55,970
See, Omar like it simple.

869
00:46:57,278 --> 00:46:58,760
So how we gonna do this, yo?

870
00:47:02,499 --> 00:47:03,842
My sister's boy.

871
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:05,391
He do the drop.

872
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:08,127
We call you and give up the spot.

873
00:47:10,347 --> 00:47:12,405
- That simple enough?
- That's what it is.

874
00:47:12,565 --> 00:47:16,031
Well see now, Joe, I need you to
resist your natural inclination

875
00:47:16,071 --> 00:47:18,175
to do anything twisted up
in this here play.

876
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:19,315
You feel me?

877
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:21,956
I even catch a whiff of you
doing something foul, Joe,

878
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,861
I mean, I might got to go
tell Marlo you the one

879
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:26,638
who put me up on that card game.

880
00:47:28,254 --> 00:47:29,576
We understood?

881
00:47:31,379 --> 00:47:34,124
Now, go ahead and write
my ticket so I can tip on out.

882
00:47:35,565 --> 00:47:36,988
Come on, now.

883
00:47:47,342 --> 00:47:48,564
Gentlemen.

884
00:47:59,513 --> 00:48:00,916
I'll see to Tremaine.

885
00:48:01,256 --> 00:48:02,659
You can't be serious.

886
00:48:02,759 --> 00:48:03,961
Was you listening?

887
00:48:04,425 --> 00:48:06,688
Omar to one side holding a spade,

888
00:48:07,253 --> 00:48:09,557
and maybe Marlo
to the other with a shovel,

889
00:48:10,607 --> 00:48:11,989
and just at this moment,

890
00:48:12,944 --> 00:48:15,528
I manage to crawl out
my own damn grave.

891
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:19,031
No way do I crawl back in.

892
00:48:21,014 --> 00:48:22,616
What the fuck is you doing, man?

893
00:48:23,364 --> 00:48:24,566
You trust him?

894
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,082
I trust his fear.

895
00:48:26,473 --> 00:48:27,776
Now we go, si?

896
00:48:27,856 --> 00:48:30,660
Not till I teach Prop Joe
a thing or 2 about devious.

897
00:48:33,028 --> 00:48:34,411
We on him, now.

898
00:48:38,855 --> 00:48:41,159
Sorry, guys, that's all I got to say.
Talk to the mom.

899
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:44,314
I hear you, but we just came from
his foster mother's house,

900
00:48:44,815 --> 00:48:47,439
and she said it was you
that told him not to talk.

901
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,590
- She said you told her to get a lawyer.
- That's right.

902
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:53,755
All right, look,
something got messed up.

903
00:48:53,935 --> 00:48:56,212
We know that,
but whatever else happened,

904
00:48:56,252 --> 00:48:57,314
we got a murder here.

905
00:48:57,374 --> 00:48:58,479
Even if it's off the record,

906
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,291
it would help us
just to talk to the boy.

907
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:02,394
If you understand what happened here,

908
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:04,114
you know I'm not gonna do that.

909
00:49:04,872 --> 00:49:07,637
If you go at it like that,
then you end up

910
00:49:07,705 --> 00:49:09,590
siding with the motherfuckers
doing the dirt.

911
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:12,155
No. I'm siding with my kids.

912
00:49:15,754 --> 00:49:17,456
You're right.
You're right.

913
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:22,124
For you,
the kids come first.

914
00:49:23,466 --> 00:49:24,724
We'll find another road.

915
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,065
Well,
glad this is working out for you.

916
00:49:34,962 --> 00:49:36,725
Oh, man, you two...

917
00:49:37,454 --> 00:49:39,378
makin' me all weepy and shit.

918
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:43,539
- Be safe, guys.
- All right.

919
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,402
Hey, Roland, man,

920
00:49:45,462 --> 00:49:47,633
you know,
I hate coming all this way

921
00:49:48,797 --> 00:49:50,520
and not getting a little something...

922
00:49:51,476 --> 00:49:53,259
you know,
for old time's sake?

923
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:02,735
The playground behind
Fulton and Monroe, unit block.

924
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,851
He told this fella Lex
to meet a girl there.

925
00:50:10,778 --> 00:50:11,986
That's all he did.

926
00:50:26,529 --> 00:50:28,492
- What's up, shorty?
Can you give me 3?

927
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:36,857
Bitch, get the fuck across the street
and plant your ass on a stoop.

928
00:50:37,057 --> 00:50:38,119
Kenard!

929
00:50:40,325 --> 00:50:42,268
How do you think I look
with no tail on my head?

930
00:50:42,328 --> 00:50:43,731
Do I look like a fag?

931
00:50:44,532 --> 00:50:45,534
Yo, Nay.

932
00:50:49,668 --> 00:50:51,291
Big yellow birds!

933
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,041
Yo, Mrs. Lee, you looking for Michael?

934
00:50:57,043 --> 00:50:59,227
Namond, I don't want to be
no trouble to you,

935
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:03,284
but I got this friend who been ailing,
you know, and she gave me $6,

936
00:51:03,504 --> 00:51:05,548
so I was hoping you could, you know.

937
00:51:09,759 --> 00:51:12,443
Yeah, we cover her.
Go see my man.

938
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,843
The fuck you do that for?

939
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:17,425
It's Michael's mom, yo.

940
00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:21,017
- Shit, she a fucking dope fiend.
- Namond said I could. Nay?

941
00:51:21,338 --> 00:51:22,597
Naw, it's cool.

942
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:24,162
Gimme.

943
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:26,425
All right, but you ain't got
to be all up on me.

944
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,314
I know, I know!
I'm late, you know?

945
00:51:29,394 --> 00:51:33,120
Sometimes it's just too much
damn fun being in charge.

946
00:51:40,978 --> 00:51:42,040
Where you been, boss?

947
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,663
Announcing my presence with authority.

948
00:51:43,723 --> 00:51:45,506
Sorry I'm late,
please sit down. Sit.

949
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:49,632
Sir, we scarfed up 52 vehicles.

950
00:51:49,692 --> 00:51:51,039
Good.
But you missed my car.

951
00:51:52,406 --> 00:51:54,830
We have new equipment at school 45,

952
00:51:54,871 --> 00:51:57,114
school 52,
and school 58 installed.

953
00:51:57,154 --> 00:51:59,381
Well, I got no calls on those,
but keep at it, though.

954
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:00,743
You'll get there, I'm sure.

955
00:52:00,943 --> 00:52:04,120
Mr. Mayor, all hydrants
are fully capped as of today,

956
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,393
and solid waste has pulled
32 tons of trash

957
00:52:06,454 --> 00:52:08,637
from the alleys, and, sir,
that's a single day record.

958
00:52:08,717 --> 00:52:09,999
That's what I want to hear.

959
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,775
Thank you, gentlemen,
and keep up the good work.

960
00:52:15,492 --> 00:52:17,230
Finance, of course,
doesn't deal with

961
00:52:17,297 --> 00:52:19,412
the dirt under the nails tangibles,

962
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:22,317
unless you consider the money
itself to be dirty.

963
00:52:23,198 --> 00:52:25,562
- So what's in your agenda today?
- The school audit.

964
00:52:25,623 --> 00:52:26,764
Well, how bad could that be?

965
00:52:26,845 --> 00:52:29,512
The system is running
a $54 million deficit.

966
00:52:32,098 --> 00:52:33,500
$54 million?

967
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:34,912
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

968
00:52:36,252 --> 00:52:37,474
Jesus Christ.

969
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:38,969
Did Royce know this?

970
00:52:40,094 --> 00:52:41,977
How the fuck do we deal with that?

971
00:52:42,923 --> 00:52:44,646
Frankly, I'm not sure just yet.

972
00:52:51,011 --> 00:52:52,132
Our attendance is excellent,

973
00:52:52,172 --> 00:52:54,897
and as to suspensions,
we don't have any.

974
00:52:55,278 --> 00:52:56,309
We intervene immediately,

975
00:52:56,349 --> 00:52:58,172
and we show success
in stabilizing behavior.

976
00:52:58,212 --> 00:53:00,638
Not to mention the world of
good we're doing for the classes

977
00:53:00,704 --> 00:53:02,506
these kids were wrecking
before the program.

978
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:05,248
In January we could
expand to 4 classes,

979
00:53:05,288 --> 00:53:06,410
cover the whole 8th grade.

980
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:07,852
Any complaints about the tracking,

981
00:53:07,912 --> 00:53:09,662
- anything from the parents?
- Not a one.

982
00:53:09,709 --> 00:53:12,288
This isn't a group where we see
a lot of parental intervention.

983
00:53:12,308 --> 00:53:13,570
What about test scores?

984
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,473
I can't speak to the program itself,

985
00:53:15,513 --> 00:53:17,687
but it has to help
the rest of the 8th grade.

986
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:19,170
Next week will tell.

987
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:27,400
Right now the system
is under a lot of scrutiny.

988
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:31,306
We have certain fiscal issues
that are of great concern

989
00:53:31,366 --> 00:53:34,717
to the new administration,
and what you're proposing here

990
00:53:34,797 --> 00:53:37,381
is a radical shift in curriculum.

991
00:53:38,451 --> 00:53:39,470
- Meaning?
- If

992
00:53:39,537 --> 00:53:42,275
city hall were to sign off on this,
we could go forward,

993
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:47,300
but now is not the time
to rock any boats.

994
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:00,798
Hear that?
That's my joint right there.

995
00:54:05,828 --> 00:54:07,832
So you all got your
work up to date, right?

996
00:54:08,152 --> 00:54:09,655
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

997
00:54:10,557 --> 00:54:12,500
I heard you took care of your
puppy's problems.

998
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,805
Oh, he most definitely made
that go away, you hear me?

999
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:17,932
It's all good.

1000
00:54:18,052 --> 00:54:20,116
You know, some of
the young's been saying,

1001
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:22,759
your pup stood tall
with a snitchin' boy.

1002
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:25,511
Michael?

1003
00:54:25,571 --> 00:54:27,114
Yeah, that's what they saying.

1004
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:29,924
Yeah.

1005
00:56:02,913 --> 00:56:05,237
Lester, you really starting
to scare me, man.

1006
00:56:42,195 --> 00:56:43,437
Need a crowbar.

1007
00:56:43,698 --> 00:56:44,717
For what?

1008
00:56:45,698 --> 00:56:47,081
This is a tomb.

1009
00:56:48,062 --> 00:56:49,244
Lex is in there.

1010
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:28,359
Fuck me.

1011
00:57:30,402 --> 00:57:34,609
