1
00:02:26,137 --> 00:02:29,876
On this Sunday
before the primary,

2
00:02:30,548 --> 00:02:34,592
When we will go to the polls
to exercise our blessed franchise,

3
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:38,843
our lesson comes from
Exodus chapter 18...

4
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:42,587
"and it came to pass,
on the morrow,

5
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,742
"that Moses sat
to judge the people:

6
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:48,912
"and the people stood by him

7
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:51,120
"from the morning
unto the evening.

8
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:54,542
"And Moses judged the people.

9
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,364
"And he shouldered this
tremendous burden all alone.

10
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,712
"And one day,
his father-in-law said to him,

11
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:06,217
"Moses,
why do you carry

12
00:03:06,304 --> 00:03:09,826
"this awesome responsibility
by yourself?

13
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:13,911
'You need other wise men
to help you rule

14
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:16,026
justly over the people.'

15
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:20,249
"So Moses harkened to the voice
of his father-In-Law,

16
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:24,663
and chose able men
to rule over the people."

17
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:27,324
Can I preach it like I feel it?

18
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,694
This Tuesday,
when we choose the men and women

19
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:38,461
who will lead our city,

20
00:03:38,706 --> 00:03:42,466
we would do well to keep
those standards in mind.

21
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:44,566
Men of truth.

22
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:49,161
Who fear God
and hate covetousness.

23
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:06,604
God bless you.

24
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:07,970
Good to see you.

25
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:09,245
How you doing?

26
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,614
- Just fine.
- How's mama?

27
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:11,739
Tell her I said hello.

28
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,424
Fellowship committee at 2?

29
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:15,198
- If I'm late...
- We'll wait.

30
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:16,296
All right.

31
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:18,867
Thank you for coming,
young man, young lady.

32
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:20,352
- Reverend.
- Councilman.

33
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,017
Mrs. Carcetti. How are you?

34
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,974
- Thank you so much for having us.
- Thank you.

35
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:25,040
Interesting sermon.

36
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:26,693
Polls seem to think
you have a chance.

37
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:28,323
Well, we're within
the margin of error.

38
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,823
Margin of error.
That's an interesting phrase.

39
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,698
And I see you've got delegate
Watkins working the crowd.

40
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,980
Well, I'm hoping he's
not going to be the only one.

41
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:37,480
I'll tell you what, councilman.

42
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:41,014
I will keep an open mind until
I walk into that booth on Tuesday.

43
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:42,166
And if you win...

44
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,628
you're holding me to a high standard.
Moses? I mean, Jesus, reverend...

45
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,193
I'm sorry.
I can't believe I said that.

46
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,057
Moses will do for now.

47
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:52,764
We'll save Jesus
for your second term.

48
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,937
- Have a good one now.
- Thank you.

49
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,458
Thank you all
so much for coming.

50
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:59,099
4x06 - Margin Of Error

51
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:57,844
- Signs o' life?
- Not even a lookout.

52
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,263
- Maybe they went to church.
- Our lady of the re-up.

53
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:03,363
He'll show up sooner or later.

54
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:04,993
Call me.

55
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:06,059
All right.

56
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:13,428
Vote for Carcetti.

57
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,711
Vote for Carcetti on Tuesday.

58
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:19,710
Tommy Carcetti running
for mayor. Thanks.

59
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,982
- Hello, councilman.
- Good morning.

60
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:23,372
I've been following your campaign.

61
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:24,627
- I'm a teacher.
- Excellent.

62
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:26,712
- High school biology.
- What? Here in the city?

63
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,788
Baltimore county,
and I just wanted say

64
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:30,701
I think your position
on school board reform

65
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:31,897
is very encouraging.

66
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,897
- So you'd vote for me?
- If I lived in the city,

67
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,194
I absolutely would.

68
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:36,433
Good luck on Tuesday.

69
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:37,551
Thank you.

70
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:41,750
They're all fucking county people.

71
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,482
We're almost done here anyway.

72
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,002
Thomas, look at this.

73
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,017
What's that?

74
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:48,749
Check it out.

75
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,543
In your private practice,
you ever represent a Bobby Harrison?

76
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,897
The slumlord? Fuck, no.

77
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:55,940
I don't remember ever
even meeting this guy.

78
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:58,099
"Carcetti got the most
serious charges dismissed

79
00:07:58,164 --> 00:08:00,077
"and the others reduced
to small fines.

80
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:02,745
"The slumlord once again walked
free with a slap on the wrist

81
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:03,856
"while hundreds of tenants

82
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,992
continue to suffer
substandard living conditions."

83
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:07,868
Last-minute smear.
They're running scared.

84
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:09,087
- Royce.
- Who else?

85
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:10,974
65% of the city rents.

86
00:08:11,126 --> 00:08:13,392
Bobby Harrison's name
is dirt in this town.

87
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,409
2 days before the election
and they smear me?

88
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:17,361
Courthouse steps.
When the fuck was this taken?

89
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:18,883
It's a fake.
They photo-shopped me.

90
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:20,013
We have time to prove that?

91
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:21,296
- We can try.
- Try, shit.

92
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:22,579
I'm gonna lose behind this.

93
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,672
Easy, Tommy.

94
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,216
We always figured
they'd pull some last-minute shit.

95
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:27,737
At least now we know what it is.

96
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:28,890
Fuck.

97
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:32,817
I want you to remember,
you representing your daddy.

98
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:35,392
Yeah, I know.
What she wanna see us for, anyway?

99
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:37,913
Maybe she got somethin'
special in mind for you, boy.

100
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:39,581
Cool.

101
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:40,950
She's a Barksdale.

102
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,928
She know talent
when she sees it.

103
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:45,841
Besides,
they owe this family a lot.

104
00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:48,569
Your daddy,
he stood tall for them.

105
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,112
I know, I know.
He a soldier.

106
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:51,503
Like father, like son.

107
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:52,786
No doubt.

108
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:57,505
What time you got?

109
00:08:58,353 --> 00:08:59,396
Half-3.

110
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:01,222
Motherfucker late.

111
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:07,679
It's for you, Marlo.

112
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:10,943
Yeah, speak.

113
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:13,703
You on it.

114
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:16,915
As long as she hit her mark,
we straight.

115
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:22,342
What time I gotta pick up
that skinny girl?

116
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:25,246
A'ight.

117
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:29,637
So what time they say?

118
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,504
Tomorrow night.

119
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,430
She be on the 8:45
from New York.

120
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:38,813
We can take care of that.

121
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:40,182
No.
I'll do it.

122
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,102
Don't want nothin' to go wrong.

123
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:44,935
You sure about that?

124
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:48,577
It's a'ight.
You can hang back on this.

125
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:52,908
Yeah,
I think I got this one, too.

126
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:54,649
Marlo Stanfield.

127
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:57,453
He ain't so much.

128
00:09:58,518 --> 00:10:00,009
Using cellphones and shit.

129
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,329
What's he sayin' now?

130
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,426
"What time I gotta pick up
the skinny girl?"

131
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:15,088
"I do it.

132
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:20,416
Don't want nothing to go wrong."

133
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:23,416
Maybe he's picking up a girlfriend?

134
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:25,122
Skinny girl from New York?

135
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,852
It's code.
Cocaine.

136
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:32,042
Damn. For Marlo himself
to get near a package...

137
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:34,179
he's a mope. I told ya.

138
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:36,062
So what do we do about it?

139
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:37,214
We work up some counter-lit.

140
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:39,432
That's why we have
a printer on retainer.

141
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,729
Best if we run-down
the original photograph.

142
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:43,251
If we can prove
this one's a fake...

143
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,093
I didn't work at "Sun papers"
for 22 damn years not to know somebody.

144
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:48,158
I'm gonna call Paul McCardle
at the photo library.

145
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,418
And if we still can't find it?

146
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,371
Then we put out
a fake photo of our own.

147
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:54,306
Show Royce in a motel
with a dead girl and a live boy.

148
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:57,212
We can't sling mud back.
Not this late.

149
00:10:57,298 --> 00:10:58,559
Relax. I'm kidding.

150
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,298
You get back on your schedule.

151
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:01,559
Hit all your stops.

152
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,648
Go to that donors' dinner
tonight and make nice.

153
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:06,184
We'll take care of this.

154
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:09,524
You can't do this to us.

155
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,698
Bey took the weight for all y'all.

156
00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:13,454
And you've been amply
compensated.

157
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,759
But time moves on.

158
00:11:14,802 --> 00:11:16,157
Not for Bey, it don't.

159
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:18,986
What I meant to say is
there's no more money coming in.

160
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:20,302
No more business.

161
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,621
Avon is gone.
So are his people.

162
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,748
Shit.

163
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:27,171
You seem to still be doin'
all right for yourself.

164
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,530
There's nothing more
I can do for you.

165
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,826
Bey know everything.

166
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:33,443
You forget that?

167
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:35,942
And what's he gonna do?
Who's he gonna tell?

168
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:38,217
And what do I care if he does?

169
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:40,550
Bey never heard me say
a damn thing about business.

170
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,855
What about your brother?

171
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:45,500
Avon could be gone longer
if Bey gets to speakin' his mind.

172
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:47,164
I couldn't care less
about Avon.

173
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:53,283
The thing is--

174
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:55,648
I wanted you both
to hear it from me,

175
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,253
so there ain't no lies
from here on in.

176
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:01,492
She even paid enough
over the last 2 years

177
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:04,522
that you should have enough
money going forward, son.

178
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:06,923
Your father has not been
disrespected here.

179
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:09,096
You both got what was coming.

180
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:11,902
But ain't nothing lasts forever.

181
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:17,672
Jailhouse snitch?

182
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:19,904
Called last overnight.
Worden talked to him.

183
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:21,892
Says for a deal,
he can give us the case.

184
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,339
No shit.

185
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:24,771
Gonna write up a writ,

186
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:26,828
send it over to the state's
attorney's office,

187
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:29,206
Get them to sign off on it
first thing tomorrow morning.

188
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,373
What's the rush?

189
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:33,450
We jump on this. We cause a major
shit stink right before the election.

190
00:12:33,493 --> 00:12:35,211
If this guy really knows
why the witness--

191
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,472
- what's-his-name?
- Braddock.

192
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:39,105
- Was killed.
- Might be bad for the mayor.

193
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:41,350
If it's not bad for
the white boy, Carcetti.

194
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:42,589
You care, either way?

195
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:44,276
Fuck no.
I don't give a shit either way.

196
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:45,483
I don't even vote.

197
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:47,810
But it'll be fun to fuck
with them downtown suits.

198
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:49,511
Maybe get you on the 11:00 news.

199
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,401
Get a little payback for all
that shit they put you through.

200
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:58,647
<i>With only 2 days left</i>
<i>before the primary,</i>

201
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:00,953
<i>campaign officials</i>
<i>traded charges today</i>

202
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,363

203

<i>in some African-American</i>

204
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:08,148
<i>What seemed to be a secure</i>
<i>lead for the incumbent mayor</i>

205
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:10,142
<i>has evaporated in recent days.</i>

206
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:13,030
<i>The latest Sun-WQMD poll</i>

207
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:15,443

211
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:28,091
I can't wait for it
to be over.

212
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:29,612
Yeah, me, either.

213
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,634
Can that flyer hurt you?

214
00:13:36,137 --> 00:13:39,299
You know, we found the original photo
In "the sun's" files.

215
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:42,618
They grafted my puss
onto some perp-walk

216
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:43,947
shot on the courthouse steps.

217
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,850
I'm standing where some
sheriff's deputy was.

218
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:46,969
Oh, my God.

219
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,024
What a nasty business.

220
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:51,083
Royce is swearing
he had nothing to do with it.

221
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:53,276
Claims it must've been
somebody freelancing.

222
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:56,089
Well, Norman and Terri
say not to worry.

223
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:57,415
It's all in the game.

224
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:01,219
You know, when I was
15 points behind,

225
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,524
I was resigned, you know?

226
00:14:04,117 --> 00:14:06,487
A landslide,
I could live with that.

227
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,639
I mean, what else did
anyone expect, anyway?

228
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,219
White guy runnin' for mayor
in Baltimore?

229
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:12,558
But this?

230
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:18,013
Jen, if I lose this here by 2
points, it's gonna kill me.

231
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:20,871
It's gonna just fucking kill me.

232
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:29,461
You gonna have
to step up now, Nay.

233
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,542
A'ight.

234
00:14:31,585 --> 00:14:33,042
Be the man of the family.

235
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,604
You older than your daddy was
when he went out on the corner.

236
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:37,756
That's what I been sayin'.

237
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:39,583
Damn.
He quit school.

238
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:41,139
You ain't quittin' school.

239
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:43,085
- Not yet.
- Ma...

240
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:45,344
But you are goin' out
on your own.

241
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:48,453
You gonna ask Bodie
for a package.

242
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:50,801
What if he say no?

243
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,763
I ain't take no for an answer.

244
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:54,780
Just did.

245
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,797
What you mean?

246
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:58,247
From Brianna.

247
00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:00,426
Hand me the damn phone.

248
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:05,851
What she say about you already
gettin' paid enough money.

249
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,743
She a lyin' bitch, Namond.

250
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:08,982
You see?

251
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:12,367
There's a lot about this world
you just don't know.

252
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:18,348
<i>What it come down to is</i>
<i>she know you ain't gonna snitch.</i>

253
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:20,240
<i>No matter what shit she pull.</i>

254
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,576
She got that right.

255
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:23,598
<i>She takin' advantage of you, Bey.</i>

256
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:25,400
<i>She takin' advantage of you.</i>

257
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:28,683
Sound like she got it
all figured.

258
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:30,400
<i>Bitch got it figured out, all right.</i>

259
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:32,911
<i>She cuttin' us loose</i>
<i>without notice. Nothin'.</i>

260
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:35,724
<i>Like comin' home, findin' our</i>
<i>shit in the street, Bey.</i>

261
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:38,877
<i>She don't give a fuck about you,</i>
<i>Avon, none of it.</i>

262
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,100
<i>She had the nerve</i>
<i>to talk to me on this,</i>

263
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,713
<i>like she gonna</i>
<i>set things straight</i>

264
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:45,712
<i>so I don't tell no lies.</i>

265
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:59,238
Jen, I'm sorry.

266
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:00,461
He said he'd be up.

267
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,983
He's already gone.
To the office.

268
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:05,450
Well, what's he doing there?

269
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:07,863
He couldn't sleep.
He's been there for hours.

270
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:10,074
Aw, shit. See ya.

271
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:17,717
And given that we still
have a shortage of officers

272
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,412
willing to work secondary
at the polling stations,

273
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:24,116
we're asking for anyone interested
to contact tactical this afternoon.

274
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:27,181
Next order of business:
fresh warrants,

275
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:29,389
beginning with murder
and weapons charges

276
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,235
on one Omar Little.

277
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,235
Anyone know this mutt?

278
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:34,584
Oh, yeah!

279
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:37,236
Who'd he kill?

280
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:38,592
Some lady in a store.

281
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:40,846
- Reads like a taxpayer.
- A taxpayer?

282
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:43,325
From what this says, he's
charged with felony homicide,

283
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:45,245
to wit, murder in
the commission of a robbery.

284
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:47,859
'Bout fuckin' time someone got
some paper on that motherfucker.

285
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,460
Anyhow, we got no fixed
address, no known abode.

286
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,690
But if apprehended,

287
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:55,197
contact detectives Holley
and Crutchfield in homicide.

288
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:56,719
You wanna find Omar Little?

289
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:59,039
You look for a corner boy
running away from a corner

290
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,235
with shit in his pants.

291
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:05,773
You ever know Omar
to do a citizen?

292
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:08,795
Anyway, pass these around.

293
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:20,374
Jesus, Tommy.

294
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:22,602
I spent a couple hours
going over the latest data,

295
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,667
rearranged the schedule.

296
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,037
A little bit
of knowledge...

297
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:26,971
there's a bunch of
middle-class black precincts

298
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:28,799
which are strong on Tony but
still undecided.

299
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:30,908
We can pick up some
votes in those neighborhoods...

300
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:32,985
those people hate the mayor.
You're gonna get them,

301
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:35,354
- and if you don't, Gray will.
- We go door to door today.

302
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:36,887
As long as they
don't go to Royce.

303
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:38,865
I need some black votes
if I'm gonna be mayor.

304
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,869
I need some kind of mandate
from that community.

305
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,706
If I sneak in with
a bare plurality...

306
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:44,522
We might just win this thing.

307
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,239
What do you think
kept me up all night?

308
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:49,044
With all due respect
to your early morning analysis,

309
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,315
We got 3 back-to-back
drive-time radio interviews

310
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,098
I wore out my kneepads to get.

311
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:57,468
The people running your campaign
are professionals, Tommy.

312
00:17:58,316 --> 00:17:59,773
Don't try this shit at home.

313
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:02,555
You know, there might
just be a job for you

314
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,055
in a Carcetti administration.

315
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:06,098
Press secretary.
Chief of staff.

316
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:07,948
Oh, get in the fucking car.

317
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:13,166
Duquan?

318
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:15,634
Mr. Prez.

319
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,286
Can you come with me, please?

320
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,917
What'd I do?

321
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:32,555
Get here early. I'll let you in,
and you can shower.

322
00:18:36,774 --> 00:18:38,057
My dirty clothes?

323
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:43,078
Put 'em in this bag,
leave 'em in the locker.

324
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:45,923
I'll bring 'em home
and wash 'em.

325
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:50,423
Go ahead and get cleaned up.
You'll be late for class.

326
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:09,255
Hey, Paul. Hey, Monnel.

327
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,842
Skanky ho.

328
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:14,018
Damn, she good, though.

329
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:15,561
Yeah, yeah.
You right about that.

330
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:18,039
Hey, yo, tiff, baby.
I got 50 cent too.

331
00:19:18,711 --> 00:19:19,885
Fuck y'all.

332
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,025
Damn. All 3 at once?
You know she could.

333
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:23,438
I know you could.

334
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:30,810
- Sir.
- At ease.

335
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:36,809
Man, I hate it when the bosses
creep below the eighth floor.

336
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:39,913
Yeah, well, I need a moment
just to unclench my asshole.

337
00:19:43,737 --> 00:19:44,933
Sir?

338
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:46,781
The Braddock investigation.

339
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:49,368
It's coming. Norris and Greggs
are wringing it out.

340
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:50,520
I fuckin' know it's coming.

341
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,864
Commissioner Burrell had
a visit first thing this morning

342
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:54,564
from state's attorney
Demper himself,

343
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:56,940
asking why one day
before the primary,

344
00:19:57,027 --> 00:19:59,527
our detectives were trying
to writ out a jailhouse snitch.

345
00:19:59,592 --> 00:20:00,787
The tip came when it did.

346
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,765
I didn't push it, and I didn't
hold it back either.

347
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:05,482
Let the chips fall
where they may.

348
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:06,678
Exactly, sir.

349
00:20:06,744 --> 00:20:09,622
Sergeant?
Fuck your falling chips.

350
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:12,014
If Braddock was killed
because he was a witness

351
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,422
and we break the case
one day before the primary,

352
00:20:14,553 --> 00:20:18,089
Royce hates us forever--
and Royce might win the election.

353
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:20,524
If Braddock was killed
for any other reason

354
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:21,741
and we break it today,

355
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:25,661
then Carcetti hates our guts--
and Carcetti could win.

356
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:26,857
I see your point.

357
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:32,698
Tactical tells me we're
still about 20 bodies short

358
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,567
for manning the polling places.

359
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:37,545
I want you
to detail 2 detectives

360
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:39,524
to uniformed election duty
immediately.

361
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:41,918
Lemme guess:
Norris and Greggs.

362
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:43,244
Sounds good.

363
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:45,918
They're to report to tactical
at 13:00 today

364
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:47,327
for election orientation.

365
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:51,409
They can pick up their writ

366
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:53,326
and talk to their snitch
on Wednesday.

367
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:55,739
American democracy.

368
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,025
Let's show those third-world
fucks how it's done.

369
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,112
Yes, sir.

370
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:08,124
I have what I think is some
very good news for all of you.

371
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:10,733
We're going to be implementing

372
00:21:10,776 --> 00:21:13,233
the university of Maryland
pilot program.

373
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,108
You're only taking 3
of my knuckleheads?

374
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:17,340
A total of 10 children
from the eighth grade

375
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:18,654
in this first class.

376
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,402
8 boys and 2 girls.

377
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:21,684
If things go well...

378
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,902
it's a start.

379
00:21:23,163 --> 00:21:24,793
- When?
- This morning.

380
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:25,943
Hallelujah.

381
00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:27,465
Not a moment too soon.

382
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:30,958
How was I?

383
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,763
Good on Steiner.
Better on the A.M. talk shows.

384
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:36,338
I thought you handled that call
about the flyers well.

385
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:37,664
Fucking Royce.

386
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,317
If I lose because of this
bullshit...

387
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,448
You lose, we can blame it on
10 different things.

388
00:21:42,449 --> 00:21:43,861
Same thing if you win.

389
00:21:44,057 --> 00:21:46,491
Guess who I just
got off the phone with?

390
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,393
State senator Davis.
He wants a meet.

391
00:21:49,546 --> 00:21:50,741
Clay Davis?

392
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,524
Why would I wanna get into bed
with that grasping motherfucker?

393
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:54,819
He didn't actually say it,

394
00:21:54,863 --> 00:21:56,754
but it sounds like
he's ready to follow Watkins

395
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:57,841
and jump the mayor's ship.

396
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,058
What's he want in return?

397
00:21:59,102 --> 00:22:01,692
Shit. Same thing
he always wants.

398
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:04,584
At least 20k to his favorite
campaign committee is my guess.

399
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:06,953
Maybe even 30, 'cause you know
Clay ain't cheap.

400
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:10,062
Well, I'm not promising
him anything policy-wise.

401
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:12,711
You think Clay Davis
gives a fuck about policy?

402
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:14,667
Naw, this is strictly
for services rendered.

403
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:16,102
He might be conning us.

404
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,302
Taking the money,
then sitting on his hands.

405
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:21,674
Maybe. But then all
we have to lose is money.

406
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:25,283
Could be the extra little push
we need on the westside.

407
00:22:26,827 --> 00:22:27,892
Set it up.

408
00:22:27,935 --> 00:22:29,066
I already did.

409
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:32,752
- Invert the denominator...
- What invert mean?

410
00:22:32,991 --> 00:22:35,513
The numerator and the
denominator switch places.

411
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:37,877
- Turn upside down.
- Why you do that?

412
00:22:38,638 --> 00:22:40,834
Because it works.
That's the formula.

413
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:42,790
Excuse me, Mr. Pryzbylewski.

414
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:47,382
Namond Brice, Darnell Tyson,
and Zenobia Dawson.

415
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,513
Grab your things
and come with us, please.

416
00:22:50,806 --> 00:22:52,828
Quiet, quiet.

417
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,871
Calm down, please.

418
00:22:54,904 --> 00:22:56,089
What'd we do?
We in trouble?

419
00:22:56,154 --> 00:22:57,252
Just come with me.

420
00:22:57,415 --> 00:22:59,719
Shit.
It's the story of my life.

421
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,175
They ain't coming back.

422
00:23:01,284 --> 00:23:03,415
Yo, Mr. Prezbo,
they gettin' arrested?

423
00:23:03,806 --> 00:23:04,821
No...

424
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:10,380
Nay, can I have your X-box? 'Cause
you ain't gonna need it where you are.

425
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,510
What'd they do?

426
00:23:11,532 --> 00:23:14,584
Markeith, Kwame, and Latonya.

427
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:16,344
Bring your things
and come with us.

428
00:23:19,574 --> 00:23:20,596
Again?

429
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:43,358
You know I can't
publicly endorse you.

430
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,706
Not at this late hour.

431
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,554
Then what are we
talking about?

432
00:23:46,988 --> 00:23:49,999
I lay back and not do what
I usually do on election day.

433
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:51,738
I see you all get a push

434
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:53,433
in the seventh
and ninth districts, say,

435
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:56,241
and maybe that piece of
the eleventh west of Freemont.

436
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:58,392
I split some of my tickets
for y'all.

437
00:23:58,718 --> 00:24:00,558
I split my walkaround money.

438
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:03,340
You know, the usual to-and-fro.

439
00:24:13,858 --> 00:24:15,663
Politics is a good thing, partner.

440
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:17,293
That's a minority opinion.

441
00:24:18,336 --> 00:24:19,380
Let's order.

442
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,810
I'm hungry enough to eat
the horse you rode in on.

443
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:26,636
If you don't mind,
we're a little busy

444
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:28,049
for a sit down lunch.

445
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:29,788
Oh, no doubt.

446
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,049
Just leave enough for the tab.

447
00:25:02,238 --> 00:25:03,560
Naw, she crazy.

448
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,060
She says you were there.

449
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:07,453
I wasn't. 'Sides, it wasn't even rape.
She wanted to.

450
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:08,931
How do you know?
You weren't there.

451
00:25:08,996 --> 00:25:10,322
I saw her go in with them.

452
00:25:10,387 --> 00:25:11,426
Go in with who?

453
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,035
This is no time to play, young man.

454
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:16,140
You are in very serious trouble.

455
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:19,423
Who did you see her go
in the boys' bathroom with?

456
00:25:19,662 --> 00:25:20,702
Paul and Monnel.

457
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,441
Paul and Monnel?
And what were you doing?

458
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:25,380
- Lookout.
- So you were involved.

459
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:26,967
But, I didn't even see
what happened.

460
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:28,206
You were standing guard.

461
00:25:28,271 --> 00:25:29,923
No, listen, Monnel gave me $5

462
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:32,688
and just told me to stand by the
door and holler if someone came.

463
00:25:32,775 --> 00:25:34,819
This isn't even fair.
I didn't even do nothing.

464
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:36,825
You stood lookout
while 2 eighth-grade boys

465
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,181
raped an eighth-grade girl.

466
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:41,079
- But she wanted to.
- That's not what Tiffanie says.

467
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:43,622
There'll be an investigation.
You'll be suspended.

468
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:45,536
You could very well be expelled.

469
00:25:45,698 --> 00:25:47,742
Maybe even face criminal
charges.

470
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,079
Mrs. Donnely, please don't.

471
00:25:49,122 --> 00:25:51,122
Mrs. Donnely, please don't
call my foster mother.

472
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:52,883
I'll tell you everything
I know about this.

473
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,106
I know all about it already.

474
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,471
No, but I know some other stuff.

475
00:25:55,602 --> 00:25:57,710
Like who been thieving
from the teacher's lounge,

476
00:25:57,754 --> 00:25:59,199
or tagging gym lockers,
or even...

477
00:25:59,242 --> 00:26:01,329
- Miss Jeffries, please.
- Mrs. Donnelly, please...

478
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:03,507
- this is Mrs. Donnelly calling
from Tilghman middle.

479
00:26:03,573 --> 00:26:04,821
Listen... I know...

480
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,777
remember, the boy who cut
Mr. Philmont's tires?

481
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:07,973
I know who did that.

482
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,108
I know about a murder.

483
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:14,456
I do.

484
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,351
We've identified
certain students

485
00:26:22,568 --> 00:26:25,503
we feel will benefit
from the special curriculum

486
00:26:25,655 --> 00:26:27,662
and the smaller class size.

487
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,205
We've chosen 10 students
from the eighth grade

488
00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:32,062
to participate in this program.

489
00:26:32,605 --> 00:26:34,279
You get chose, you got to go?

490
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:35,605
That's right.

491
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,169
What if you don't wanna?

492
00:26:37,234 --> 00:26:38,647
It's mandatory.

493
00:26:39,756 --> 00:26:42,998
We feel that this program
will benefit everyone.

494
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:45,931
You'll get the attention
you need.

495
00:26:46,344 --> 00:26:48,170
And we outta
everybody else shit.

496
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:51,822
My bad. I ain't mean to curse.

497
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:53,544
Yeah, but you're right, though.

498
00:26:53,892 --> 00:26:56,305
This class get tore up,
it's only on y'all.

499
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,892
So we get put outta class.

500
00:26:58,277 --> 00:27:00,211
This is a classroom, too.

501
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,465
And every one of you has proven
time and again

502
00:27:05,018 --> 00:27:07,493
that you're not ready
for a regular classroom.

503
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:13,033
But this is a new program
that if you work it

504
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,997
is going to make you ready.

505
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,170
Ready for gen-pop.

506
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,552
This is prison, yo.
And we in solitary an' shit.

507
00:27:21,835 --> 00:27:23,340
- Word.
- Solitary.

508
00:27:25,297 --> 00:27:29,603
That's good, son.
This is solitary.

509
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:32,668
This is the hole up in here.

510
00:27:38,184 --> 00:27:39,553
He's a good kid.

511
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:40,988
He really is.

512
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:44,883
And once you make that call,
his name's gonna be in the system.

513
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,057
What can I do?

514
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,774
He says he knows about a murder.

515
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:50,322
I have to notify police on this.

516
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,580
At least let me call
someone I trust.

517
00:28:26,056 --> 00:28:27,295
That's him right there.

518
00:28:27,578 --> 00:28:28,599
Stand by.

519
00:28:28,926 --> 00:28:30,882
- You don't wanna be in on the collar?
- Nah.

520
00:28:30,947 --> 00:28:33,273
If you take it, he'll think
it's a straight interdiction,

521
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:35,686
and I get to surprise him
at the bail review.

522
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:38,838
<i>Good evening,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

523
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:40,138
<i>Can I have your attention.</i>

524
00:28:40,205 --> 00:28:43,205
<i>Now boarding at</i>
<i>gate letter D, track 4,</i>

525
00:28:43,272 --> 00:28:49,286
<i>the southbound 8:45 acela</i>
<i>express from New York,</i>

526
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:52,096
<i>making station stops at</i>
<i>BWI rail station</i>

527
00:28:52,161 --> 00:28:54,603
<i>and Union station, Washington.</i>

528
00:28:56,321 --> 00:28:58,234
Sister,
help you with your bag?

529
00:28:58,299 --> 00:28:59,387
No, thank you.

530
00:28:59,517 --> 00:29:00,561
Don't be afraid.

531
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:03,691
Why should I be afraid?
Who are you?

532
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,219
Just walk you to the door.

533
00:29:05,546 --> 00:29:07,219
My husband is waiting outside.

534
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:08,328
Like to meet him.

535
00:29:08,393 --> 00:29:10,171
I'll wait with you.
Make sure you're safe.

536
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,280
That really won't be necessary.

537
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:13,584
Amtrak police, sir.

538
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,540
Excuse me, could you
step over here please?

539
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:16,713
What is this?

540
00:29:16,953 --> 00:29:17,974
Give me the bag.

541
00:29:18,018 --> 00:29:19,125
What is going on?

542
00:29:19,995 --> 00:29:22,690
I don't know this man.
Where are you taking me?

543
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:28,228
What'd he say about it?

544
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:29,510
Nothing much.

545
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:31,293
Drugs?

546
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:35,310
I didn't question him too close.

547
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,006
A murder.

548
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:40,469
I should take it downtown.

549
00:29:40,556 --> 00:29:42,142
Who knows
what he really knows?

550
00:29:42,686 --> 00:29:46,237
I just, I don't want to see him
get chewed up by the system.

551
00:29:48,324 --> 00:29:50,010
Let me try to keep this close,

552
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:53,287
give it to someone with
a little bit of discretion.

553
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,578
Appreciate it.

554
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,057
- Carver.
- Carver?

555
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:58,557
Ellis has come a long way.

556
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:00,233
I think he'd be right for this.

557
00:30:02,472 --> 00:30:05,667
Why do you care?
And what's this kid to you?

558
00:30:05,992 --> 00:30:07,166
I don't know.

559
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:10,824
He's one of my students.

560
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:15,559
Sergeant.

561
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:19,211
Clean. Both of 'em.

562
00:30:19,255 --> 00:30:20,342
Say what?

563
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:22,769
Nothing in that bag
but ladies clothes.

564
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:24,986
Nothing dirty on
either one of 'em.

565
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:29,694
Unless you got another idea,
we gotta cut 'em loose.

566
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:37,287
From what he says,
he was just a go-between.

567
00:30:37,483 --> 00:30:38,874
He delivered a message.

568
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:42,564
He told the victim to be at a
certain place at a certain time.

569
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,766
Then how does he know?

570
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:46,157
He says everyone knows
what happened to Lex.

571
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,439
It's in the streets.

572
00:30:48,048 --> 00:30:49,534
This other thing at the school.

573
00:30:49,643 --> 00:30:51,824
I swear I didn't do it, Miss Anna.

574
00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:53,497
I didn't do it. You'll see.

575
00:30:53,563 --> 00:30:56,791
School's gonna look into that,
we're gonna look into this.

576
00:30:57,878 --> 00:31:00,746
As long as Randy cooperates,
tells everybody the truth...

577
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:01,876
but if word got out...

578
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,968
understand.

579
00:31:03,707 --> 00:31:06,808
That's why he's gonna go to school,
keep his mouth shut,

580
00:31:07,113 --> 00:31:10,634
his nose clean,
go about his business.

581
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:14,204
Child's shown such
bad judgment in both instances.

582
00:31:14,335 --> 00:31:15,335
Agreed.

583
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:18,562
But from what I can tell,
he's not a bad kid.

584
00:32:00,365 --> 00:32:01,431
Dennis?

585
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:04,405
Where you goin' at so early?

586
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:07,492
Oh, I'm gonna go run,
and then I got lawn work later.

587
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,107
You comin' back, right?

588
00:32:10,368 --> 00:32:12,064
What you mean
am I comin' back?

589
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:14,715
It's gonna be like that, huh?

590
00:32:16,215 --> 00:32:17,867
What do you mean? Like what?

591
00:33:32,889 --> 00:33:34,390
- Where to?
- Highlandtown.

592
00:33:34,477 --> 00:33:36,564
Flush out yo' base,
little trooper.

593
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:49,647
What up, Spider?

594
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:50,995
Hey, shorty.

595
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:53,690
Thank you, but I know
how I'm voting.

596
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:55,634
I'm gonna be late for work.

597
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,043
Miss Anna, is it OK if I stand
out here while you go vote?

598
00:33:59,196 --> 00:34:01,644
- Don't you go nowhere, boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

599
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:03,013
So, what up, man?

600
00:34:03,383 --> 00:34:04,992
So, how much they
payin' you for this?

601
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:08,313
They say like 40, but I gotta
work the whole day though.

602
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,209
- Know what I mean?
- Yo, Spider.

603
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:18,478
- Yo, that was Spider, right?
- Yeah.

604
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:19,739
Well, where'd he go?

605
00:34:22,124 --> 00:34:24,298
No, thank you, man.
I can't vote.

606
00:34:24,385 --> 00:34:25,450
Conviction?

607
00:34:26,624 --> 00:34:28,179
- Felony?
- Move on, man.

608
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,031
A'ight, man.

609
00:34:30,423 --> 00:34:33,646
You see Spider again, you tell
him he need to come past my gym.

610
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:36,472
He ain't been 'round in weeks,
an' we need to talk. A'ight?

611
00:34:36,603 --> 00:34:37,672
A'ight.

612
00:34:39,064 --> 00:34:40,346
Where's the older kid?

613
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:42,554
- Don't know.
- OK. You're hired.

614
00:34:42,946 --> 00:34:45,012
Shove one of those
into every hand you can.

615
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,415
Thank you very much.

616
00:34:58,586 --> 00:35:00,173
Why you ain't at school?

617
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:01,684
Ain't no school today.

618
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:03,423
One them Jew holidays?

619
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:04,641
'Lection.

620
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,119
So what you gonna do?

621
00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:08,284
Dunno. Hang.

622
00:35:08,327 --> 00:35:10,132
What'd I say about steppin' up?

623
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,875
Brianna turn off the faucet.
We gotta make some rain.

624
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,571
I'ma get dressed.
We go see Bodie.

625
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:27,689
Kid,
I got something else for you.

626
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:29,841
Put one of these in every door

627
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:31,533
between the expressway
and Winchester,

628
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:33,008
and from Freemont to Fulton.

629
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:35,291
You can do it by yourself
or you can get some friends,

630
00:35:35,356 --> 00:35:37,791
but I'm gonna come past this
afternoon, make sure it's done.

631
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,380
OK. One in each door. Cool.

632
00:35:39,793 --> 00:35:41,228
This is for the day's work.

633
00:35:43,258 --> 00:35:46,099
That's your walk-around.
But don't you fail me.

634
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:49,012
Took forever.
What's all this, son?

635
00:35:49,121 --> 00:35:52,621
Man said if I put these fliers
in doors, I can get paid.

636
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,555
I come right home after.

637
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:55,947
You right you will.

638
00:35:56,316 --> 00:35:58,012
You ain't in these streets no more.

639
00:35:59,186 --> 00:36:00,261
No, ma'am.

640
00:36:01,783 --> 00:36:02,935
Sounds like she mean it.

641
00:36:05,568 --> 00:36:07,264
11:00 news, huh?

642
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:09,025
Shut up.

643
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:10,959
I'm on this shit detail

644
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:12,826
because you wanted
to stir the pot.

645
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,254
And tomorrow,
if we bust open the Braddock case,

646
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:17,906
nobody's gonna give a fuck.

647
00:36:18,015 --> 00:36:19,276
Life is timing.

648
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,289
No shit, fucknuts.

649
00:36:25,841 --> 00:36:27,363
Tommy Carcetti.
How you doing?

650
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:29,145
- 'S a cute one.
- Thanks.

651
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,295
Hey, Tommy Carcetti.
Hope you're voting today.

652
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:32,403
I am.

653
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:34,501
Well, who's it gonna be?
Give me a hint. Come on.

654
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:37,110
- Don't keep me in suspense.
- You don't have to worry about me.

655
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:38,172
Appreciate it.

656
00:36:44,128 --> 00:36:45,745
Tommy Carcetti,
running for mayor.

657
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,158
Nice to meet ya.

658
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:50,155
- How much longer?
- I think we can wrap this up.

659
00:36:50,198 --> 00:36:51,764
We got a lot more places
to be today.

660
00:36:52,264 --> 00:36:54,416
Tommy Carcetti.
I knew your dad.

661
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,693
- First district democratic club.
- No kidding.

662
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,589
Just wanted to say
you got my vote.

663
00:36:58,632 --> 00:36:59,632
Thank you.

664
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,967
They had their chance.
Look what shape the city's in.

665
00:37:03,033 --> 00:37:05,728
I'm hoping to turn things around.
Anyway, thanks for your support.

666
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:07,838
I mean, you expect
politicians to steal.

667
00:37:07,904 --> 00:37:08,991
I don't, actually...

668
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:11,164
It's part of the game.
I understand that.

669
00:37:11,382 --> 00:37:14,653
But we took one dollar outta
every 3, not 2 outta 3,

670
00:37:14,718 --> 00:37:16,218
like these moolies.

671
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:19,647
I mean, leave something
for the city, for Christ sake.

672
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:22,455
Am I right?
Best of luck, councilman.

673
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,913
Moolies?

674
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,034
Sorry.

675
00:37:30,925 --> 00:37:32,121
'Lection flyers?

676
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,645
Yeah, just run up,
stick 'em in mailboxes,

677
00:37:34,714 --> 00:37:36,171
you know, screen doors,
whatever.

678
00:37:36,192 --> 00:37:37,192
What about the vacants?

679
00:37:37,236 --> 00:37:40,518
- We ain't even got to do the vacants.
- Shit. Some blocks ain't nothing but.

680
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:42,859
That's what I'm saying.
This be easy money.

681
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:44,216
- Don't wanna do it?
- I do it.

682
00:37:44,283 --> 00:37:45,292
Me, too.

683
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:47,023
Yo, this shit'd
be easier if we had a car.

684
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:50,048
Dag, donut. I'm in enough
trouble with Miss Anna as is.

685
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:51,634
So, what up, Mike? You in?

686
00:37:52,461 --> 00:37:54,534
All right, then.
I'll holla at you later, boy.

687
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,290
Look, Namond's been--
What's the word?

688
00:38:02,355 --> 00:38:03,377
He been inconsistent.

689
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:06,051
You know sometimes he be doin' good,
Then other times, he just--

690
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:08,432
We talked about that.
He gonna do better.

691
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:10,801
Ain't you?

692
00:38:10,845 --> 00:38:12,637
Election day special, 2 for 2!

693
00:38:13,397 --> 00:38:15,073
- I don't know.
- Oh, I do.

694
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:17,508
You gonna give this boy
his own package

695
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:19,225
or there gonna be some Drama.

696
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:22,363
You want me to talk to Wee-Bey?
Maybe you wanna talk to him.

697
00:38:22,449 --> 00:38:24,429
I give you his number.
He got a cellphone.

698
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:25,712
All that's not even necessary.

699
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:27,603
I got all the respect
in the world for Bey.

700
00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:29,785
Then show some for his family.

701
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:38,847
Make me proud, hear?

702
00:38:49,836 --> 00:38:51,020
Damn, boy.

703
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,541
Your mama's what niggas call
a dragon lady.

704
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:55,345
She don't blink.

705
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,031
Yeah,
gimme some insight, though.

706
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,275
To what?

707
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,297
Why you is what you is.

708
00:39:25,355 --> 00:39:27,746
Yo. What up?
Where y'all goin'?

709
00:39:28,377 --> 00:39:29,746
Hungry, man. I need to eat.

710
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:31,442
Nah, come one.
Let's finish this.

711
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,009
- Nah, yo. This shit is boring.
- Fuck it.

712
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:37,381
Yo, listen, man, I ain't even gonna pay
y'all If you don't finish the job, so...

713
00:39:37,468 --> 00:39:38,924
You already got the money?

714
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:41,455
Fool, if the motherfucker
paid you out already,

715
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:43,042
then why the hell are we still here?

716
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:44,455
'Cause this is the job.

717
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,233
Shit, the man ain't got
nobody to blame but hisself.

718
00:39:47,299 --> 00:39:48,951
It's his fault for payin' up front.

719
00:39:48,994 --> 00:39:51,016
Yo, you need to split
that money up or something

720
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,864
'cause time is a-wastin'.

721
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,851
Didn't even finish the day's work.

722
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:03,590
Get me something at least.

723
00:40:03,786 --> 00:40:04,851
Lake trout.

724
00:40:04,894 --> 00:40:06,703
- Soda too?
- Yeah. Strawberry.

725
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:07,812
A'ight. I got ya.

726
00:40:40,954 --> 00:40:42,019
Where the crew at?

727
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,889
Randy got 'em all some job

728
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:45,628
Handin' out election flyers
or whatever.

729
00:40:46,106 --> 00:40:47,237
You ain't wanna do that?

730
00:40:48,408 --> 00:40:50,799
Hell, no. It's bullshit, man.

731
00:40:51,104 --> 00:40:52,974

732
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,343
Yeah, with Bodie.
I'm movin' the package.

733
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,439
You wanna go in on it with me?

734
00:41:00,244 --> 00:41:03,223
You sure?
We could work together.

735
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:05,267
Nah, man, that's your thing.

736
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:07,271
Go do what you do.

737
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:10,184
Yeah, a'ight.
I'm gonna holler at you.

738
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,471
She cute one, ain't she?

739
00:41:26,232 --> 00:41:29,340
Yeah, boy.
You know I love the women.

740
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,827
Hey, you seen Spider
around any?

741
00:41:38,675 --> 00:41:41,045
I mean, he ain't been 'round
the gym in like a month, man.

742
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,859
I leave messages, he don't call.

743
00:41:44,174 --> 00:41:46,696
I don't understand, man.
He was one of my best welterweights.

744
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:48,848
Now, why would he just
quit like that?

745
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,427
Why don't you ask his moms?

746
00:41:55,976 --> 00:41:59,432
Well, shit.
I was locked up a good while, right.

747
00:41:59,508 --> 00:42:01,139
I mean I ain't no angel.

748
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,461
Naw. You ain't that.

749
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:15,039
Thanks a lot, folks.

750
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:16,930
Good job. Keep it up.
We're almost home.

751
00:42:17,006 --> 00:42:19,167
You're the best. The best.

752
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:23,015
Heavy turnout all around.

753
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:25,246
Big lines on the westside
might be bad for us.

754
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,290
I dunno but--

755
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:28,531
<i>We're out here in west Baltimore,</i>
<i>Lafayette square,</i>

756
00:42:28,618 --> 00:42:30,227
<i>The heart of his political base.</i>

757
00:42:30,338 --> 00:42:31,382
This is today?

758
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:33,446
This is live, right now
in Lafayette square.

759
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,250
Clay Davis just said
his whole organization

760
00:42:35,294 --> 00:42:37,229
was out going door-to-door
for Royce's ticket.

761
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:38,787
So much for laying back
on the mayor.

762
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:40,700
We paid $20,000 for this shit?

763
00:42:40,787 --> 00:42:43,706
He probably went to Royce and
shook him down for another 30.

764
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:44,858
Motherfucker.

765
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:46,880
Clay Davis must know
something we don't.

766
00:42:47,454 --> 00:42:49,888
He knows just enough
to get paid twice.

767
00:42:50,128 --> 00:42:52,513
Gotta blame ourselves
for payin' this thief up front.

768
00:42:52,622 --> 00:42:53,992
Hey, it was worth a shot.

769
00:42:54,057 --> 00:42:55,956
<i>Aides to the mayor</i>
<i>have told me privately</i>

770
00:42:56,022 --> 00:42:57,174
<i>that they are concerned...</i>

771
00:42:59,652 --> 00:43:00,770
Thanks, yo.

772
00:43:07,693 --> 00:43:09,323
I'ma get me a cold one.

773
00:43:42,326 --> 00:43:43,369
Grab the wall.

774
00:43:50,914 --> 00:43:52,132
Officer walker.

775
00:44:01,303 --> 00:44:03,216
I ain't gonna be
out here strapped.

776
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:09,096
Aw, you gonna take that
on a humble?

777
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,062
Boy, you don't know there's
rules to this here game.

778
00:44:14,127 --> 00:44:15,562
- Rules?
- Yeah.

779
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:29,046
Where your shotgun at,
Mr. Omar?

780
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,773
What is wrong with y'all, man?
Y'all ain't got no charges here.

781
00:44:31,816 --> 00:44:33,229
Charge is murder,
motherfucker.

782
00:44:33,294 --> 00:44:35,447
Murder?
Who I kill?

783
00:44:36,476 --> 00:44:37,466
Hey, Omar.

784
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:39,161
McNulty. What the hell
goin' on here, yo?

785
00:44:39,205 --> 00:44:40,205
You tell me.

786
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,770
We got a warrant for
a robbery murder. In a store.

787
00:44:46,258 --> 00:44:47,453
Wagon's here.

788
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:57,695
Hey, yo, McNulty,
I need a phone, yo.

789
00:44:57,738 --> 00:44:58,955
Fuck your phone.

790
00:45:00,803 --> 00:45:03,431
If I'm going to booking,
I need to make a call tonight, yo.

791
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:12,204
4-10-958-6612.

792
00:45:13,465 --> 00:45:14,834
An' let it ring.

793
00:45:16,901 --> 00:45:17,966
Here.

794
00:45:19,662 --> 00:45:21,097
Yo, Butchie.
I'm locked up, yo.

795
00:45:21,162 --> 00:45:22,684
<i>What you need?</i>
<i>I got your bail.</i>

796
00:45:22,836 --> 00:45:24,499
Nah, no bail.
They sayin' it's murder.

797
00:45:24,565 --> 00:45:26,891
<i>Murder? Well,</i>
<i>don't worry. I got ya.</i>

798
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:38,719
You some kinda democrat or what?

799
00:45:41,957 --> 00:45:44,631
<i>Voter turnout was heavy</i>
<i>all day across the city</i>

800
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,332
<i>with some precincts</i>
<i>reporting lines</i>

801
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:48,875
<i>as soon as the polls opened</i>
<i>at 7 this morning.</i>

802
00:45:48,984 --> 00:45:50,462
<i>Election officials, however,</i>

803
00:45:50,527 --> 00:45:52,751
<i>reported few problems</i>
<i>throughout the day.</i>

804
00:45:53,055 --> 00:45:54,533
<i>Now the polls have closed,</i>

805
00:45:54,623 --> 00:45:56,688
<i>officials at the board</i>
<i>of elections downtown</i>

806
00:45:56,775 --> 00:45:59,732
<i>have begun the tedious process</i>
<i>of tallying the vote,</i>

807
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:02,546
<i>prepared for what could be</i>
<i>a long night.</i>

808
00:46:02,655 --> 00:46:06,611
<i>With just over half of the</i>
<i>city's 316 precincts reporting,</i>

809
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:10,951
<i>councilman Thomas j. Carcetti</i>
<i>has a narrow lead of 2%.</i>

810
00:46:11,429 --> 00:46:14,508
<i>Traditionally, those precincts</i>
<i>that report latest</i>

811
00:46:14,682 --> 00:46:16,529
<i>tend to be from west Baltimore,</i>

812
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:19,995
<i>which is expected to favor</i>
<i>mayor Royce in the late going.</i>

813
00:46:27,677 --> 00:46:28,872
How it go?

814
00:46:28,894 --> 00:46:30,785
Good. Nothin' to it.

815
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:34,438
I'm countin' on you, Nay.

816
00:46:45,141 --> 00:46:47,582
<i>Exit polls done earlier</i>
<i>in the day in key precincts</i>

817
00:46:47,647 --> 00:46:51,060
<i>show voters divided over the</i>
<i>challenges facing this city,</i>

818
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:53,429
<i>such as crime and education.</i>

819
00:47:05,758 --> 00:47:07,236
<i>Be quite an election.</i>

820
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:09,736
<i>Since this race tightened</i>
<i>in the last couple of weeks,</i>

821
00:47:09,779 --> 00:47:11,932
<i>I've been saying</i>
<i>that this election</i>

822
00:47:11,975 --> 00:47:13,601
<i>would be won on the ground.</i>

823
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:16,470
<i>And whoever has the best</i>
<i>field operations will take it.</i>

824
00:47:16,557 --> 00:47:18,840
<i>It's all about the turnout,</i>
<i>and this is--</i>

825
00:47:18,894 --> 00:47:20,089
What about bond?

826
00:47:24,864 --> 00:47:25,864
Yeah.

827
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,560
All right. Talk to you in a few.

828
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,397
Bond's running really strong
against Demper.

829
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,146
Looks like we might have
a new state's attorney.

830
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:37,929
What does that mean for you?

831
00:47:38,168 --> 00:47:39,603
Well, Demper's Royce's boy.

832
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:41,939
Dare to get
your hopes up, Tommy.

833
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:46,070
You know what?
Let's get outta here for a while.

834
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,744
Take a walk.

835
00:48:13,911 --> 00:48:15,128
I'll get your ass.

836
00:48:36,085 --> 00:48:37,193
Pretty.

837
00:48:37,324 --> 00:48:38,585
A little ripe.

838
00:48:40,498 --> 00:48:42,867
Well, can't do anything about
the way the harbor smells.

839
00:48:42,933 --> 00:48:44,677
People are gonna expect you to.

840
00:48:45,112 --> 00:48:46,416
I guess.

841
00:48:46,938 --> 00:48:48,112
You sound confident.

842
00:48:48,394 --> 00:48:49,761
I have a feeling.

843
00:48:57,848 --> 00:48:59,500
Could be a great city again.

844
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,413
Pull some jobs in here.

845
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:05,787
People move back,
fix up the houses.

846
00:49:07,939 --> 00:49:09,265
It's ringing again.

847
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:13,851
Terri.

848
00:49:13,894 --> 00:49:15,199
Maybe you should answer it.

849
00:49:15,307 --> 00:49:17,068
I don't need an update
every 5 minutes.

850
00:49:17,111 --> 00:49:19,056
- No, we should go, anyway.
- Do we have to?

851
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:22,034
I'm sure they're frantic.
They don't know where you are.

852
00:49:26,489 --> 00:49:27,489
Yeah?

853
00:49:29,294 --> 00:49:30,859
Taking a walk with my wife.

854
00:49:37,562 --> 00:49:38,657
On our way.

855
00:49:46,323 --> 00:49:47,628
Royce is conceding.

856
00:49:48,802 --> 00:49:50,193
The westside precincts came in

857
00:49:50,258 --> 00:49:52,693
and we pulled 2 outta 5 votes
in some precincts.

858
00:49:53,693 --> 00:49:55,084
We stole his base.

859
00:49:56,884 --> 00:49:57,906
We won.

860
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:00,906
Are we happy about that?

861
00:50:04,058 --> 00:50:05,210
I think so.

862
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:08,775
I think we are.

863
00:50:11,188 --> 00:50:12,275
Yeah.

864
00:50:17,955 --> 00:50:19,129
You sure?

865
00:50:40,747 --> 00:50:42,182
Thank you. Thank you.

866
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,934
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Please.

867
00:50:52,691 --> 00:50:55,408
I want to thank you all for
your hard work and dedication.

868
00:50:55,843 --> 00:50:57,517
Give yourselves a hand. Come on.

869
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,482
I just got off the phone with
mayor Royce and councilman Gray.

870
00:51:05,504 --> 00:51:07,569
They were very gracious.
I asked for their help.

871
00:51:07,591 --> 00:51:09,613
I mean, we still have
a general election to win.

872
00:51:13,959 --> 00:51:15,307
Is there
a republican candidate

873
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:17,475
for mayor in Baltimore?
I don't know. I'm not sure.

874
00:51:18,627 --> 00:51:20,627
But, assuming
that we win, we still have--

875
00:51:20,736 --> 00:51:23,221
We still have a lot of work
to do to turn this city around,

876
00:51:23,265 --> 00:51:26,083
and we need everyone--
Everyone who's willing to join us

877
00:51:26,148 --> 00:51:28,632
in making a better Baltimore
for our children.

878
00:51:33,743 --> 00:51:35,960
I don't want to make a long speech.
Believe me.

879
00:51:36,423 --> 00:51:38,966
You don't want to hear it.
I don't want to make a long speech,

880
00:51:39,031 --> 00:51:42,013
so I'll thank each of you individually.
But for tonight, let's celebrate.

881
00:51:57,942 --> 00:51:59,029
How you doin'?

882
00:51:59,268 --> 00:52:00,877
Thanks. Hey.

883
00:52:01,572 --> 00:52:02,594
Damond.

884
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:04,790
I look forward to working
with you, Mr. Mayor.

885
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,747
Likewise.
And congratulations to you, too.

886
00:52:06,769 --> 00:52:07,790
Thank you.

887
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,225
I'm going home.

888
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:11,861
No, come on. Stay.
I won't be long.

889
00:52:11,905 --> 00:52:14,275
Yeah, you will.
It's your night.

890
00:52:17,744 --> 00:52:18,939
Tommy. Tommy.

891
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:20,635
Look what washed up
on the beach.

892
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,418
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

893
00:52:23,396 --> 00:52:26,182
Just came by to wish you well.
Looking forward to working with you.

894
00:52:26,247 --> 00:52:27,508
Shouldn't you be dead to me?

895
00:52:27,573 --> 00:52:30,372
Shit.
I took it easy on you, son.

896
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:32,611
I coulda had you
for twice as much.

897
00:52:33,462 --> 00:52:34,723
You got off cheap.

898
00:52:36,702 --> 00:52:37,941
He's right.

899
00:53:08,095 --> 00:53:09,225
Butchie sent us.

900
00:53:20,353 --> 00:53:21,418
What you in for?

901
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:24,160
I'm here on a 22-55.

902
00:53:26,877 --> 00:53:28,116
I talked back.

903
00:53:35,096 --> 00:53:36,437
- Moolie?
- Moolie.

904
00:53:37,416 --> 00:53:38,698
He said that in front of you?

905
00:53:38,845 --> 00:53:40,693
He made a point of it, in fact.

906
00:53:40,824 --> 00:53:42,780
You're the one said
I oughta Shore up my base.

907
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,345
You didn't call him on it?

908
00:53:44,411 --> 00:53:45,824
The ironies of democracy.

909
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,543
A vote's a vote.
And I never throw one back.

910
00:53:48,782 --> 00:53:51,075
Speaking of ballots,
did you vote for me, Norman?

911
00:53:51,206 --> 00:53:53,123
The sanctity
of the voting booth

912
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:56,033
is a cornerstone
of American democracy.

913
00:53:59,294 --> 00:54:00,910
I gotta go. You need a ride?

914
00:54:00,953 --> 00:54:02,018
Yeah.

915
00:54:02,084 --> 00:54:04,837
- Come here. You're the best.
- Thanks, Norman.

916
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:07,727
Yeah, take a break.

917
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,009
- You got it.
- One day.

918
00:54:09,074 --> 00:54:10,312
- Come here, you.
- 2 days.

919
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,351
- Be good.
- I'm gonna call you.

920
00:54:13,373 --> 00:54:14,808
I have a feeling you might.

921
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:17,364
We are family.

922
00:54:18,038 --> 00:54:20,486
I got my Carcetti and me.

923
00:54:23,682 --> 00:54:24,718
Good night.

924
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:30,640
I should go, too.

925
00:54:31,162 --> 00:54:32,357
One for the road?

926
00:54:32,748 --> 00:54:33,813
Sure.

927
00:54:35,574 --> 00:54:37,439
- Scotch OK?
- Sure.

928
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,651
You know, I gotta admit,
it feels good.

929
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:48,586
You deserve it.

930
00:54:49,934 --> 00:54:51,111
You worked hard.

931
00:54:51,763 --> 00:54:52,937
I did. I do...

932
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:56,644
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

933
00:55:03,482 --> 00:55:07,166
You know, when I took this job,
you promised me a win bonus.

934
00:55:07,448 --> 00:55:08,601
Well, you earned it.

935
00:55:34,168 --> 00:55:36,038
I can't do this. Not now.

936
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,016
Oh, come on, Tommy.

937
00:55:40,059 --> 00:55:41,603
You haven't changed.

938
00:55:41,994 --> 00:55:43,377
Hell, from what Norman tells me,

939
00:55:43,442 --> 00:55:46,485
you nearly fell off
the campaign trail for a blonde

940
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:49,281
at the stonewall dinner
2 months ago.

941
00:55:49,476 --> 00:55:51,455
He had to drag you out of the bar.

942
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,049
It's not that
I don't want to...

943
00:55:56,766 --> 00:55:59,136
You're feeling
a bit mayoral. Right.

944
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:01,362
You're on stage now.

945
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:03,814
Well, Tommy,

946
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,358
4 years is a long time
for a fellow like you.

947
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,067
This could be your
last chance for a while.

948
00:56:29,771 --> 00:56:30,945
You sure?

949
00:56:35,315 --> 00:56:37,315
Maybe you have learned something.

950
00:56:50,754 --> 00:56:51,928
Write me a check.

951
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:05,625
