1
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:21,600
See, to cap a motherfucker,

2
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,933
you put a pistol to his head,
say, "pow," and he tagged.

3
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:27,368
- But when Chris and them do it--
- It ain't working, nay.

4
00:00:27,408 --> 00:00:28,510
I know you making this up.

5
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,852
Word to my mother, yo.

6
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:33,451
Lex ain't dead. I seen him creeping in
an alley last night near the playground.

7
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:34,999
Everybody know Lex is dead.

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,499
Nah, there's dead,
and there's special dead.

9
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,793
Yeah,
Chris working that juju shit.

10
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:42,418
Nah, man.
What I'm saying is they zombies.

11
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:44,441
Why you think he take them
into vacants?

12
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:45,984
He need time to change them.

13
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:48,271
You don't believe me,
yo, it's on you.

14
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:50,056
Yo, they funnin', ain't they, Michael?

15
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,233
I don't know about
that voodoo shit, man,

16
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:54,499
but Chris is definitely
doing something.

17
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:55,999
Get a nigger to walk up in there

18
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:57,665
knowing he about
to get capped, man.

19
00:00:57,732 --> 00:00:58,970
Chris, he different.

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,090
You can tell by them coon-ass
country clothes that nigger be wearing.

21
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:05,193
9?

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,865
Nah, too much bark.
Probably a 40-cal.

23
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:12,498
Yeah, man,
this is serious business.

24
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:14,065
So you saying Lex is a zombie?

25
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:16,430
Pookie, Byron,
all them niggers.

26
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,322
- And Chris?
- Yeah, Chris--

27
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:19,635
zombie master.

28
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:22,631
I knew this wasn't going away.

29
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:24,623
That's what we've been
trying to tell you, yo.

30
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:25,925
Chris got the power.

31
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:28,031
He tell them to come,
and they got to come,

32
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:29,931
like the devil do
with the damned.

33
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:31,731
What you think
Chris got them doing?

34
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:34,395
Probably spies, man.

35
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:37,630
Can't figure any other way
Marlo knows so much.

36
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:38,930
Yeah, that's what it is.

37
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:40,998
Like in this movie,
"zombie killer" or something,

38
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:43,133
they came out at night,
hunting.

39
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,731
- Hunting?
- Yeah, man. They...

40
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:52,398
yeah, and in that movie,
they was snatching people up,

41
00:01:52,563 --> 00:01:54,131
stealing their warmth.

42
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,587
4x05 - Alliances

43
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:05,740
St. Jude,
patron of lost causes.

44
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,425
Tell me you ain't
been on bended knee

45
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:11,268
whispering in his saintly ear
each and every night

46
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:12,759
before you close those peepers.

47
00:04:12,923 --> 00:04:15,725
I know you have, Tommy,
catch a break like this.

48
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:17,840
Stan, you're sure about this?

49
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,558
On my mother's soul,
it's a lock.

50
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,597
Assigned a rookie--
a broad, no less--

51
00:04:21,657 --> 00:04:23,008
as lead detective.

52
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:25,325
Pulled a good man off, too, I heard.

53
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:28,014
Tom.

54
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:32,561
Tommy, remember,
anything you need.

55
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:39,290
He's a piece of work.

56
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:41,455
Valchek?
Comes with the territory.

57
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:43,783
You want the first district
council seat,

58
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:46,026
you make nice with whatever
Polish or Greek Commander

59
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,122
- they dump in the southeast.
- Not Italian.

60
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,832
There ain't enough of us
left down there.

61
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:50,995
You think he has this right?

62
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:53,804
- That Royce tampered with the case?
- No way the mayor knows.

63
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:57,458
You're right. This one has
Ervin Burrell written all over it.

64
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,785
Fuck if the mayor knows or not.

65
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:01,189
If it's true, we get it out there quick
and bang him hard.

66
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:02,251
I go public?

67
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:04,962
They can't spin this.
They sabotaged a criminal case.

68
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:06,204
No spin on a knuckleball,

69
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:08,382
you still can't tell
how it's gonna break.

70
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:17,196
We feed it to Tony Gray.

71
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:20,274
We keep ourselves out of the line
of fire, sting Royce,

72
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:23,560
and as an added bonus,
give Gray's campaign a boost

73
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,419
which comes at the expense
of the mayor's base.

74
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,020
I'm a devious motherfucker
once I get going.

75
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:34,827
So, all told,

76
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,744
we're looking at 13 warrants
and 6 locations.

77
00:05:38,113 --> 00:05:40,117
And given my staffing situation...

78
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:41,689
not a problem.

79
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:45,127
I can give you my D.E.U.,
flex, and ops squads.

80
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:46,789
A sector of uniforms
if you need it.

81
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,653
- Great.
- The problem is,

82
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:51,123
you're wasting a wiretap
on street-level arrests.

83
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:52,355
We do these raids right,

84
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:55,655
we might catch Marlo or one of his
lieutenants at one of these locations,

85
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:57,055
get them with dope on the table.

86
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:58,163
Marlo Stanfield.

87
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:00,222
In a room.
With dope on the table.

88
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:01,554
I've kicked down doors

89
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:03,602
and surprised bigger players than him.

90
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,755
Well, let me warn you, Lieutenant,

91
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:09,838
I am not about to litigate
a wiretap for a handful of street rips.

92
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,098
Well...
that's on you, Counselor.

93
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,901
No, it's not.

94
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:17,072
Major, see you tomorrow.

95
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,063
Floaters. You had any more?

96
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:30,320
No more than usual for the season.

97
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:31,453
What about decomps?

98
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,054
What do you got
in the decomp room?

99
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:35,403
- 2 or 3 unidentifieds.
- Found in Baltimore?

100
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:37,902
No, actually, two from Prince George's,
one from Dorchester.

101
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,453
Nah, he wouldn't drive that far.

102
00:06:39,642 --> 00:06:40,787
Let me get this straight.

103
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:43,048
You're looking for extra bodies,
no one in particular,

104
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:45,481
other than this one kid you
already put out on the teletype.

105
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:46,884
Yeah. You on it.

106
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,414
You fellas don't have enough work?

107
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:54,588
If you do your classwork,
homework,

108
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:56,030
you earn stickers.

109
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,614
Dag, yo, every day
you be changing it up.

110
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:00,660
You got us confused, Mr. P.

111
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,701
Behave in class,
that's another sticker.

112
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,721
At the end of the week,
the 4 with the most stickers

113
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:09,153
get a prize

114
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,722
and are eligible for a grand drawing
at the end of the month.

115
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:17,035
Don't do your work,
misbehave in class...

116
00:07:19,443 --> 00:07:20,865
your name goes here.

117
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:23,153
Detention.

118
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,771
A full hour after school,
no exceptions.

119
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:26,985
So it's up to you:

120
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:31,119
stickers for prizes
or stay with me after school.

121
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,232
Yo, Mr. P.
Why you do me detention?

122
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:35,318
You interrupted the class, Namond.

123
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:36,685
Yo, when you
first came in here,

124
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:38,455
you was all treating us straight up,

125
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:41,263
and now you just dog me
before I even know the rules.

126
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:42,705
That ain't right, man.

127
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:51,307
When you're right, Namond,
you're right.

128
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:53,929
Hey, Mr. P.,
I want me some of them stickers.

129
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:56,118
Zenobia,
you have to do your work.

130
00:07:56,284 --> 00:07:59,329
I want to,
but I ain't got no pencils.

131
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:07,801
I don't want no damn
welfare pencil!

132
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:23,966
It seems to me

133
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:27,361
there are two kinds of kids
walking in this building:

134
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:30,183
stoop kids, corner kids.

135
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,049
- Excuse me?
- You know, stoop kids.

136
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,845
The ones who stay on their front
steps when their parents tell them.

137
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,308
The others go down
to the corners.

138
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:38,279
They can't sit still in the class.

139
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,683
The others can and do.

140
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:41,083
So separate the two.

141
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:43,383
- That's tracking.
- Excuse me?

142
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,150
Tracking students.

143
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:47,275
It's a nasty phrase
in educational circles.

144
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:50,727
It refers to the grouping of children
based on expected performance.

145
00:08:50,787 --> 00:08:51,889
Well, what's wrong with it?

146
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:54,807
It says you have reduced
expectations for certain students,

147
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:57,513
that you expect less from them
academically.

148
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,388
So you pretend
to teach all these kids,

149
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:02,466
and the truth is,
you ain't teaching any of them.

150
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:04,669
but what if the stoop kids
could be in classrooms

151
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:07,025
- where there was no disruptions?
- And the corner kids?

152
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:08,748
They're the ones you're after, right?

153
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:10,356
That's why you got the grant money.

154
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,949
As long as this doesn't
involve warehousing children,

155
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,248
I'm for anything that
allows me to do my job.

156
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:17,348
Every teacher here
will tell you the same.

157
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,415
The trick for you
is to come up with a program

158
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:21,987
that actually addresses itself
to the corner kids.

159
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:24,171
I don't know. If we pull kids
out of regular classes,

160
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,481
won't they be stigmatized?

161
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:28,314
There's not a stigma at being
booted out of class every other day?

162
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:29,681
Question is,

163
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,748
how do we identify the corner kids?

164
00:09:31,814 --> 00:09:33,140
That won't be a problem.

165
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:35,929
OK.

166
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:48,086
You understand the work?

167
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,035
Come on, this is easy.
I know you can do it.

168
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:01,822
You're not giving me a choice.
You have detention.

169
00:10:02,197 --> 00:10:04,281
Yo, nay, Mrs. D. shaking bushes.

170
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:07,015
Back to your seats.

171
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:11,446
What the fuck?
She got my blade, yo.

172
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:13,317
I said, back to your seats.

173
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:22,316
Yo, Mrs. D. Be stealing shit.

174
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:24,119
I ain't never gonna
get my blade back.

175
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:29,738
Yo, you all up on me for?
I do my work.

176
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:32,521
I'm not your yo.
Show me your work.

177
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:39,210
Yeah, I see.

178
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,233
Yo, my hand hurting
from all this learning.

179
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:43,535
You got some tylenol?

180
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,903
What I got for you is detention.

181
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:50,259
Yo, fuck you, Prezbo.

182
00:10:50,978 --> 00:10:53,382
Fucking gimpy-assed,
big-grill motherfucker.

183
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:55,349
That's it. You're out of here!

184
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:00,477
Go!

185
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:11,143
Get your police stick
out your desk and beat me.

186
00:11:11,223 --> 00:11:12,818
You know you fucking want to.

187
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,699
Everyone back in your seat.

188
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,482
The fuck you looking at, bitch?

189
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:24,057
Ms. Sampson, I--

190
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:26,944
Namond Brice, if you weren't
headed to the main office,

191
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,034
you are now.

192
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:29,156
Yeah, I was just...

193
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:34,664
one of the corner kids, huh?

194
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:38,745
Yeah, they do step up
when you need them, don't they?

195
00:11:38,877 --> 00:11:41,962
Look, what? You want me
to say you right, you right.

196
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:44,910
Should have had protection
at the card game.

197
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:46,304
Done is done.

198
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,746
Now we need to decide
what we're gonna do about Omar.

199
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,075
You make the price right,

200
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:53,054
somebody gonna get a whiff
of that bushwhacker's ass.

201
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:55,463
Now, you take it from there.

202
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:57,029
You think so?

203
00:11:58,245 --> 00:11:59,743
I ain't saying Omar can't be got.

204
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,080
Any nigger can be got.

205
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:02,909
But once we put word to ear

206
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:04,876
and he learn
that we pricing out his head,

207
00:12:04,943 --> 00:12:06,945
he's gonna be trying us
like we're trying him.

208
00:12:08,355 --> 00:12:09,843
You saying
I should let it slide?

209
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,606
Nah.
Nah, we get at him another way.

210
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,714
Get at him without no bounties,
no bullshit like that.

211
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,209
I mean, Barksdale turned this
town upside down hunting him,

212
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:20,817
and all he ended up
looking was weak.

213
00:12:20,877 --> 00:12:22,408
I ain't no Barksdale.

214
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,272
I'm just saying talk is cheap.

215
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:27,708
We sit on it, We gonna figure out
a way to get that faggot.

216
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:31,458
But till then,
we don't say a mumbling word.

217
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:39,699
I got me 6 now,
and I'll give you the 4 later,

218
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,143
all right? Come on!

219
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:42,913
Nah. I'm gonna need the whole 10 now.

220
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,031
Sherrod!

221
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:46,693
You ain't in school?

222
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:48,456
I'm half a day.
Teachers' meeting.

223
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:51,108
Come on, I told you
about those lame excuses, man.

224
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:52,351
I was talking to him first.

225
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:53,620
Ain't no need for physical--

226
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,563
you got $4.00 for me?
I'm short $4.00.

227
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,253
What the fuck are you talking!

228
00:12:58,435 --> 00:12:59,874
Got a cart full of shit, nigga.

229
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:02,156
What you got for me?
I know you holding.

230
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:04,368
Where's it at?
You ain't hear?

231
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:08,428
It's in my shoe. My shoe.

232
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:16,760
Don't need the 4 now, son.

233
00:13:30,248 --> 00:13:32,031
Damn, yo, where the shovel at?

234
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:33,391
Bury that nigger, man.

235
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:57,053
Here you go, sir. Thank you.

236
00:13:57,113 --> 00:13:59,377
- Tommy Carcetti, running for mayor.
- Good luck, Tommy.

237
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,222
- Mr. Carcetti, you got my vote.
- Thanks.

238
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,114
- Tom Carcetti.
- Hey. Thank you very much.

239
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:04,196
Good luck, councilman.

240
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:06,280
How you doing?
Tommy Carcetti, running for mayor.

241
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,848
OK, councilman,
time to hit the west side.

242
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:23,130
Pretty motherfucker.

243
00:14:23,671 --> 00:14:25,911
Gonna make me
go to my game face.

244
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:31,936
OK. I'll take 25 of
the honeysuckle incense cones.

245
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,571
Keep me healthy for next week.

246
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:35,173
Tommy!

247
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,636
Excuse me.

248
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:41,670
Tony Gray's people
say 20 minutes at their place.

249
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,290
Shit, Clarence.

250
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,403
Look like you did in '98 when you
surprised the hell out of everyone.

251
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,701
Bring 'em on.

252
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:55,826
Why give it to us?

253
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:57,569
Why don't you stick it
to Royce yourself?

254
00:14:57,609 --> 00:14:59,478
Because after what Tommy did
at the debate,

255
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:02,737
it'll seem like more of the same
if it comes from him.

256
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:06,443
And if we use it to take 4
or 5 points out of Royce's base,

257
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:08,594
helps him as much as us.

258
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:10,753
Once bitten, twice shy.

259
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:13,535
With Tommy Carcetti, I got
to always think a step ahead.

260
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,027
Look, Tony.
You ain't gonna win.

261
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,688
So the only question is

262
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:21,144
whether you want to lose with
24% of the vote or 28%.

263
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:23,667
You bring the numbers up,

264
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,134
you look good for the legislature.

265
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,176
Maybe a congressional run.

266
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,523
Albert stokes.

267
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,169
Here. Mr. P., can I go?

268
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,802
My mom's told me to go
straight home after school.

269
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:36,335
- Mine, too.
- Mine, too.

270
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:40,621
You should have thought of that
before you smeared ink all over my desk.

271
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:42,609
Weren't my fault.
My pen exploded.

272
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:47,152
Michael. Michael Lee?

273
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:50,219
Mr. P., please, can I go?

274
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:53,168
I ain't eat no lunch, and my
stomach making all these noises.

275
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:57,468
Look. I won't ever disrespect
your pencil again, I promise.

276
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:59,735
Zenobia, it wasn't
about the pencil.

277
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:01,515
Please, Mr. P.

278
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:13,810
OK. OK.

279
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:16,257
- All right.
- All right.

280
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:18,281
Just this one time,
I'll make an exception.

281
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:23,595
But next time,
expect to stay the full hour.

282
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,741
Why are you here?

283
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:38,833
Came to say sorry.

284
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,297
I didn't mean to get all
up in your face like that.

285
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:44,483
I appreciate that, Namond.

286
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,466
It takes courage
to admit when you're wrong.

287
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:47,733
What I can't understand,

288
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,033
I've seen you in Ms. Sampson's
class doing your work.

289
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,564
Why can't you
do the same in here?

290
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:52,908
I mean to, I do.

291
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,831
It's just the evil get in me,
and before I know it, I go off.

292
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:00,366
Well...

293
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:03,181
tomorrow we'll see
if we can't do better.

294
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:05,593
Can't tomorrow.
Mrs. D. Put me out.

295
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:08,316
I got to bump. Later, Mr. P.

296
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,449
If you can wait outside...

297
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:15,538
it's OK. He can stay.

298
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:21,629
Thank you.

299
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:26,453
Mr. P., you know Michael
can't make it to detention.

300
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:28,465
I know he didn't.
Now it's double.

301
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:29,870
He's got two days to serve.

302
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,321
Nah. I mean he can't.

303
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:33,547
He got to go pick up
his little brother from school.

304
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:36,480
Well, he'll just have to
find somebody else to do that.

305
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:39,464
It-- It ain't like that.

306
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,174
I mean,
Michael would come if he could,

307
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:43,878
but wouldn't have nobody else
to pick up his little brother bug.

308
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,603
You know, his mother,
she on that stuff.

309
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:55,161
We walking home. You coming?

310
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:57,671
Oh, no. I'm waiting on Alpo.

311
00:17:57,751 --> 00:17:59,294
Ms. Sampson got him
doing detention.

312
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,797
You gonna be here till, like, 5:00.

313
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,035
Yeah. She a hard lady.

314
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:03,831
She don't ever give
a brother no play.

315
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:05,875
Well, all right, man.
I'll holla at you later.

316
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:07,160
All right, yo.

317
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:12,055
So you're not gonna be
in the NBA?

318
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:13,741
Then it must be the NFL?

319
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:17,763
I thought all the boys in class
were gonna join the pros.

320
00:18:17,951 --> 00:18:19,895
Nah, that's just something we say.

321
00:18:20,227 --> 00:18:21,549
So what about you?

322
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:24,747
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

323
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:26,791
I'm gonna own my own store.

324
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:28,407
That's smart.

325
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:30,512
You're gonna need to know
a lot of math.

326
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,061
You left them in there.

327
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,824
Hey, don't worry, Mr. P.
We got you.

328
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:41,945
Hey, donut!

329
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:46,871
Yo, donut's crazy with cars.
He can open anything.

330
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:48,738
What up, man.

331
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,793
He locked his keys in there.

332
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:57,029
It's OK. I can call AAA.

333
00:18:57,154 --> 00:18:58,596
Oh, no problem, chief.

334
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,359
Feel the need
to work them corners, huh?

335
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,911
I'm just asking because you don't
need to be doing what you're doing.

336
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:50,115
I need to learn some shit
on my own.

337
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,507
I'm trying to help you, Sherrod,

338
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:54,731
but you making it so I can't.

339
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:57,022
I didn't even know
the man who beat on you, Bubs.

340
00:19:57,122 --> 00:19:58,793
He was short money
on the corner.

341
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:00,591
I swear he wasn't nothing to me.

342
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,536
Yeah, but when the shit start,
There's nothing to be done, right?

343
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,604
What would I have done
if he started wailing on you?

344
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,542
Same kind of nothing, see?

345
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:11,305
That's how the corners be.

346
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:14,566
They gonna use you up, Sherrod.

347
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,657
You welcome to stay tonight,

348
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:24,193
but you ain't in school
tomorrow morning,

349
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:26,090
this partnership need to be done.

350
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,991
These two precincts
are the bellwether for the fifth.

351
00:20:58,097 --> 00:21:01,323
If you can take even 18%
out of Carcetti in these,

352
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:03,924
it's a good guess he won't
have the numbers citywide.

353
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:06,182
And who are we ticketed
with over here?

354
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:08,271
The N.D.O., I hope, because...

355
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:12,192
<i>...this amid allegations</i>

356
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:14,557
<i>...that high-ranking</i>
<i>police officials intervened</i>

357
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:18,569
<i>to have a veteran police detective</i>
<i>removed from the controversial case.</i>

358
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:21,724
<i>the Braddock murder became a</i>
<i>focal point in the mayoral campaign</i>

359
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:24,036
<i>when councilman</i>
<i>Thomas Carcetti alleged</i>

360
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:25,951
<i>the west Baltimore man was killed</i>

361
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:27,957
<i>because he was a witness in the case.</i>

362
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:29,172
<i>Because they were afraid</i>

363
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:31,148
<i>the police would prove</i>
<i>what they most fear,</i>

364
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,650
<i>that Fredro Braddock was murdered</i>

365
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,556
<i>because he was a witness</i>
<i>and the city failed to protect him.</i>

366
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:39,489
It's on all 3 channels.

367
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:42,534
And the "Sun" and the "Post"
are both calling for comment.

368
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,254
<i>And my sources within the department</i>
<i>say the rank-and-file officers</i>

369
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:51,689
<i>are simply appalled by</i>
<i>this blatant political manipulation.</i>

370
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:53,060
Damn. Turn it up.

371
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:55,804
Hey, Greggs, you're famous.

372
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,222
<i>...is to remove</i>
<i>a highly decorated veteran,</i>

373
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:00,416
<i>15 years experience</i>
<i>as a murder investigator,</i>

374
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:01,489
<i>without reason...</i>

375
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:03,332
- That'd be me.
- <i>Then replaced with a rookie</i>

376
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:05,563
who has yet to handle
a single homicide investigation.

377
00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:06,621
That'd be you.

378
00:22:06,688 --> 00:22:09,060
- <i>then we need to rethink...</i>
- the fuck I ever do to him?

379
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:14,955
You gonna make it too heavy, yo.

380
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,953
It might work
if we make it bigger.

381
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:20,036
It would work if we had balsa wood,
you know. It's really light and strong.

382
00:22:20,076 --> 00:22:21,486
Man, you so full of...

383
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:23,475
oh, shit.

384
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,342
Zombie master.

385
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,044
Need to take us a little walk.

386
00:22:40,468 --> 00:22:41,590
Nah, I'm good here.

387
00:22:43,608 --> 00:22:45,131
Young'uns need to move along.

388
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:48,621
Sure, Chris, we'll bump.

389
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,454
Yo, Snoop,
your sister in my class.

390
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,453
What the fuck?
You high or something, nay?

391
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:02,020
You boys be smoking that shit?

392
00:23:06,392 --> 00:23:07,994
Hearing good things about you.

393
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:10,424
Say you straight up,
take care of your people,

394
00:23:10,504 --> 00:23:11,905
not begging no handouts.

395
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:15,549
Motherfucker, you hear
the nigger talking to you,

396
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:17,087
giving you praises and shit.

397
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:18,979
You standing here
looking fucking stupid.

398
00:23:19,053 --> 00:23:20,161
Yo, chill.

399
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:23,553
Sometimes, she get a little hot.

400
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,783
I'm just saying
the boy ain't right!

401
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:28,933
Yo, we always in the market
for a good soldier.

402
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:32,417
When we see one we like,
we take care of the situation.

403
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:35,504
Take him in, school him,
make him family.

404
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,986
And if you're with us,
you're with us,

405
00:23:38,046 --> 00:23:40,244
just like we'd be with you
all the way.

406
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,229
You have a mind, you're in.

407
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,126
Look, man.
I already got a family.

408
00:23:45,963 --> 00:23:48,466
My moms and my little brother--

409
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:49,902
Yeah. Heard that.

410
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,618
But think on it.

411
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,903
We'll be around
if you need something.

412
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,085
He saw me, yo. I knew it.

413
00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:17,172
I knew Chris was asking Michael
about me.

414
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:18,955
I knew it, man. I'm dead.

415
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:23,118
Yo, man, good looking out.

416
00:24:23,576 --> 00:24:25,419
- I thought they was gonna--
- Yeah, I know.

417
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,540
What did he ask about me?
I know he asked about me.

418
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,602
What'd you tell him?

419
00:24:28,662 --> 00:24:30,396
Calm down.
It weren't even about you, man.

420
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,941
For real, man, you need to tell me.
What did he ask you?

421
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:36,017
Yo, you right, man.

422
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:38,168
Chris was all up
in your business.

423
00:24:38,504 --> 00:24:40,888
He down on you
for some deep shit, man.

424
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:42,598
I don't even know what.

425
00:24:45,805 --> 00:24:47,508
Nah, I'm just fucking
with you, man.

426
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:49,554
He didn't even speak your name.

427
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:57,948
Oh, man.

428
00:25:01,621 --> 00:25:03,183
So, Erv, what's next?

429
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:05,515
Your officers gonna shoot
a couple of tourists?

430
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,184
Maybe fly a helicopter
into harbor place?

431
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:11,916
What can we expect the last week
of my reelection campaign?

432
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,276
Sir, I did what you asked--
no more, no less.

433
00:25:14,356 --> 00:25:16,849
Hamsterdam--
legalized drug zone?

434
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,282
He takes responsibility for that.

435
00:25:18,348 --> 00:25:20,570
- The subpoenas all over town.
- That, too.

436
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,988
The leak about the witness murder.
I mean, that was his shop, too, right?

437
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:26,356
- Hell, yeah.
- And now, this last thing,

438
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:29,787
transferring detectives
off the case.

439
00:25:30,173 --> 00:25:31,347
What is that?
What is that?

440
00:25:31,414 --> 00:25:33,108
Scuttling the investigation.

441
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:34,972
Yeah, right.
Yeah, that's awful. Jesus.

442
00:25:35,048 --> 00:25:38,117
Mr. Mayor, you asked me
to slow that investigation down.

443
00:25:39,492 --> 00:25:40,654
Subtle, Ervin?

444
00:25:41,715 --> 00:25:43,548
You hold a few facts
for a few weeks.

445
00:25:44,212 --> 00:25:46,656
You put a report or two
in a desk drawer.

446
00:25:47,162 --> 00:25:49,726
But the transferring of people
off a case?

447
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,748
Look. You told me

448
00:25:51,815 --> 00:25:53,577
you specifically
wanted me to not--

449
00:25:53,638 --> 00:25:55,861
Ervin, you may leave.

450
00:25:56,813 --> 00:26:00,620
- Mr. Mayor--
- That will be all, commissioner.

451
00:26:13,803 --> 00:26:16,906
No, I need a word or two
with your deputy, Ervin.

452
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:31,379
Have a seat.

453
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:40,349
I tried to warn him.

454
00:26:40,793 --> 00:26:43,227
I mean, if it leaked out of
homicide about the dead witness,

455
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:45,531
why wouldn't it leak
that we bumped a detective?

456
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,612
Why didn't you
come to us beforehand?

457
00:26:49,313 --> 00:26:51,336
I'm a loyal subordinate, Mr. Mayor,

458
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,179
and Ervin is a good man working
under considerable pressure.

459
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,712
He's a hack.

460
00:26:56,752 --> 00:26:59,276
You're not bothered
by the pressure, deputy?

461
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:00,776
Not in the least.

462
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:08,709
I need you to make this go away, Bill.

463
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:10,972
I won't forget, believe me.

464
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:26,296
Another thing--
Slim Charles got up with me.

465
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:27,877
Said the fat man want a sit-down.

466
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:30,078
Nah. I did that already.

467
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:33,811
Well, Slim say the fat man knew
the card game was gonna get took.

468
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:35,109
He did, did he?

469
00:27:36,342 --> 00:27:37,424
Set it up.

470
00:27:38,044 --> 00:27:39,528
Why you always be back here?

471
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,812
Quiet.
And I can see what comes.

472
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:43,936
But you out in the weather and shit.

473
00:27:44,016 --> 00:27:45,611
I don't like to speak in no rooms.

474
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,832
Yeah.

475
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:48,855
Yo. You ain't staying long.

476
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,543
So you know,
I almost got that for you.

477
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,509
I just need
a couple of days more.

478
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,133
You can keep my money for now.

479
00:27:58,325 --> 00:27:59,776
I got something
that needs doing.

480
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:01,410
Anything, Marlo. Your call.

481
00:28:01,543 --> 00:28:05,132
Omar gonna come in your store,
stick it up, rob you.

482
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:07,670
You gonna call the police,
make a report.

483
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:11,221
- You feel me?
- Yeah, that'll work, but...

484
00:28:11,342 --> 00:28:13,865
you know when he get out,
he's coming right at me.

485
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:16,112
I ain't scared or nothing.
I'm just saying, you know?

486
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,374
He ain't gonna get out.

487
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:26,688
A man make bail on robbery.

488
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:29,603
Make it no bail.

489
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:34,333
If you have a problem,

490
00:28:34,827 --> 00:28:36,730
like you can't make it to detention,

491
00:28:37,142 --> 00:28:38,288
you need to tell me.

492
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:40,566
That's your responsibility.

493
00:28:40,975 --> 00:28:43,144
People will be more than willing
to help you out,

494
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,308
but it's up to you to ask.

495
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:49,441
You can go back to the cafeteria...

496
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:52,165
or hang up here.

497
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,908
Duquan.
Could you come here?

498
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,689
I thought maybe you
could help me out.

499
00:29:19,182 --> 00:29:20,404
I packed too much.

500
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,497
Take this down to the cafeteria

501
00:29:42,537 --> 00:29:44,820
and get yourself something
to drink from the machine.

502
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,603
Thank you.

503
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,384
Crystal, you got a second?

504
00:30:01,494 --> 00:30:02,736
What's up with Duquan?

505
00:30:02,923 --> 00:30:05,204
I gave him some new clothes.
I was expecting--

506
00:30:05,277 --> 00:30:06,439
He might have lost them.

507
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,593
That fast?

508
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:12,197
It weren't that.

509
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:15,030
His people take his clothes,
sell it on the corners.

510
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:16,378
You're kidding.

511
00:30:16,418 --> 00:30:18,320
No, sir.
Everybody knows.

512
00:30:22,973 --> 00:30:24,736
Which brings me to
what we're proposing.

513
00:30:24,776 --> 00:30:26,481
Different kids,
different approaches.

514
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:29,271
You tell us who we need to touch
at north avenue to get the go-ahead.

515
00:30:29,337 --> 00:30:30,575
The puzzle palace?

516
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:33,274
Look. If y'all still
want to jump in and help,

517
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:34,504
I'm fine with it.

518
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:36,738
That's about all the OK
you need in my house.

519
00:30:38,635 --> 00:30:41,300
The Stricker Street situation
is waiting in the office.

520
00:30:44,228 --> 00:30:47,072
Neighborhood squabbles,
and my babies bring it in here.

521
00:30:47,276 --> 00:30:48,478
Two fights yesterday,

522
00:30:48,978 --> 00:30:51,062
all because the mothers
can't get along.

523
00:30:51,698 --> 00:30:52,700
I got to go.

524
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,064
Mrs. Donnelly will work out
the nuts and bolts.

525
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,911
But, just so you hear it,
thank you.

526
00:30:59,864 --> 00:31:03,390
It'll be the only time anyone
in this system will think to say it.

527
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:08,936
He's a good man.
You need to protect him.

528
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:09,978
Protect him?

529
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:12,203
Principal Withers just
went out on a limb for you,

530
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,003
and in this system,
they know how to handle a chainsaw.

531
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:16,886
Excuse me?

532
00:31:17,928 --> 00:31:21,328
Anyone has a problem
with what we're doing, it's on him.

533
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:24,264
So, you specified
eighth-graders?

534
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,786
We have 256 on roll.

535
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:31,259
241 attend on a regular basis.

536
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,502
Of those, 40 or so would fit
your Bill of corner kids.

537
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,882
40?

538
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:39,531
Pretty workable.

539
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:43,932
What would you suggest?

540
00:31:43,992 --> 00:31:45,234
Start with 10 or so.

541
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:46,968
Ms. Sampson has enough
to get you going.

542
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:48,702
One of them
named Namond Brice?

543
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,132
Pick of the litter.

544
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:52,935
But you'll have to wait.
He's on a 3-day suspension.

545
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:04,309
Remember when I was a cadet,

546
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:06,334
I was up here
on a cadaver search.

547
00:32:06,494 --> 00:32:08,289
Instructor gets
on the radio to say,

548
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:10,568
we're looking for one body
in particular.

549
00:32:11,978 --> 00:32:14,079
"If you go grabbing
everyone you see,

550
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:16,015
we'll be here all day," he says.

551
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:18,199
Leakin Park,

552
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,822
where West Baltimore
brings out its dead.

553
00:32:21,168 --> 00:32:23,342
Not anymore,
from the look of things.

554
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:25,778
Not by the roadside, anyway.

555
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,067
If he's dumping them here,

556
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:32,449
he's dumping them
deep in the woods.

557
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:36,514
Come on.

558
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,114
At each raid site,

559
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:42,496
we're anticipating
dope or cash or guns.

560
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:47,766
All warrants are for prime locations
linked to high-level violators.

561
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,764
Weeks-old addresses
linked to low-level corner boys.

562
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,232
We'll also be sweeping drug
corners at these locations.

563
00:32:53,364 --> 00:32:55,933
Wagons will hold
in this location here.

564
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:58,268
Jump-off time, 1500 hours.

565
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,705
We take our position 10 minutes
before the assault, here.

566
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:03,980
The go is on my say-so.

567
00:33:05,912 --> 00:33:07,735
Questions?
Excellent.

568
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,234
We'll hold the rec room
till it's time to stage.

569
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:18,773
Warrants are one thing,

570
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,865
but street sweeps on
Marlo Stanfield's crews?

571
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:21,930
Are you guys serious?

572
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,193
Carv, you give these
hoodleheads too much credit.

573
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:25,789
Trust me on this, boy wonder.

574
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,766
Never mind this horseshit.

575
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:31,001
So what've they got you
doing for your man?

576
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:32,403
Who, the Lieutenant?

577
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:34,006
No, Royce.

578
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,365
Herc, the mayor's your meal ticket.

579
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,988
He gets another 4 years,
you're liable to wear the Gold braids.

580
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:41,591
Shouldn't you be out waving
a campaign sign or some shit?

581
00:33:46,634 --> 00:33:49,879
And so ends the last crusade
of the major crimes unit.

582
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:51,708
With a whimper.

583
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,949
Lester would cry to see his
wiretap cannibalized for that crap.

584
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,386
Street sweeps
on Marlo Stanfield?

585
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:04,098
So what else you got cooking?

586
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:05,372
Narcotics cases?

587
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,401
C.I.D. Has the Burman indictment
coming in.

588
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:08,743
Nothing past that.

589
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:13,335
As wars go, this drug thing
seems to rate less and less.

590
00:34:14,267 --> 00:34:17,332
If Demper wins and manages
to forgive my trespasses,

591
00:34:17,804 --> 00:34:19,767
maybe I'll go in
and beg for something new.

592
00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:21,234
I don't know.

593
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,578
Just...
feels like enough's enough.

594
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:28,134
Crutchfield. Line two. Intake.

595
00:34:32,366 --> 00:34:34,863
- Sergeant, you were looking for me?
- I was, yeah.

596
00:34:35,026 --> 00:34:37,931
Curly fry?
Chicken doohickey?

597
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:40,029
Sit down.

598
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:48,167
Norris is back
on the Braddock case.

599
00:34:49,644 --> 00:34:51,429
It's by order of the deputy ops.

600
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:55,129
In fact, we're gonna go with a story
that says he was never off the case,

601
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,696
that you and he are partnered,
a task force of two,

602
00:34:57,857 --> 00:34:59,279
working it together.

603
00:35:01,424 --> 00:35:02,766
Fuck you, fat man.

604
00:35:04,662 --> 00:35:07,461
Not original, but succinct.
I like your approach.

605
00:35:07,528 --> 00:35:10,473
Y'all humiliate me once
by dropping me into this thing,

606
00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:13,617
and now you're gonna shame me again
by bringing Norris back.

607
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:29,698
This is homicide, detective.

608
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,528
This is not some
boiler room unit

609
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,791
where no one pays attention to whatever
the fuck it is you call police work.

610
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:37,366
The bosses?
They know our names up here.

611
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:41,142
Now, I didn't like it
when they came to me

612
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:42,660
and told me to dump Norris,

613
00:35:42,803 --> 00:35:44,061
but dump him I did.

614
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:46,231
And it's not like I want
to carry water for them now

615
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:48,859
that they're pretending they
never told me to do any such thing,

616
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:51,164
but carry the water I will.
And in the end,

617
00:35:51,263 --> 00:35:54,188
when everyone else in this unit
is buried and beshitted,

618
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:57,192
this detective Sergeant
will still be standing.

619
00:35:59,815 --> 00:36:02,579
So...
get the story straight.

620
00:36:02,972 --> 00:36:04,527
Norris was always the primary,

621
00:36:04,587 --> 00:36:06,738
and you are now assisting
on an investigation

622
00:36:06,804 --> 00:36:09,067
which is progressing
even as we speak.

623
00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:12,000
Does the Colonel know about this?

624
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,653
He's in the hospital.

625
00:36:15,192 --> 00:36:16,566
Chemo didn't work.

626
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:23,426
Press conference is upstairs
in half an hour.

627
00:36:23,492 --> 00:36:24,693
So don't be late.

628
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:26,153
Press conference?

629
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,874
I ain't mean to laugh at you none.

630
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:39,191
I know it sound crazy,
but I ain't joking.

631
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,336
For real, Lex a zombie.

632
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,958
I knew it way before
what nay and them was saying.

633
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:46,009
Listen.

634
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,224
They had me tell Lex
to go up to the playground.

635
00:36:49,352 --> 00:36:51,436
I told him to go up there
and see some girl.

636
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,499
He ain't never come back down.

637
00:36:54,153 --> 00:36:56,817
So what they gonna do to me
when they get mad at me?

638
00:36:57,059 --> 00:36:59,324
It makes sense Chris taking them
into the vacants--

639
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:01,692
to change them...
and you know what else.

640
00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:03,257
That ain't what he's doing.

641
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:07,419
Chris and the vacants...
changing them?

642
00:37:08,357 --> 00:37:10,152
He ain't changing them;
he killing them.

643
00:37:10,253 --> 00:37:11,959
That's all.
They're getting killed.

644
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:13,441
How you know?

645
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:18,424
Can't tell nobody.

646
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:21,824
I seen it.

647
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,725
I seen them walk a boy up into
one house over there on Calhoun.

648
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:28,897
You seen that?

649
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:31,607
Yeah.

650
00:37:32,738 --> 00:37:33,923
That's just false.

651
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:36,471
Detective Norris has been
working this case nonstop,

652
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:38,583
and given her narcotics expertise,

653
00:37:38,663 --> 00:37:42,423
detective Greggs was assigned to
augment rather than to replace him.

654
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:43,790
But for two days,

655
00:37:43,855 --> 00:37:45,756
sources inside the department
were saying--

656
00:37:45,817 --> 00:37:48,758
I'm inside the department,
and I'm telling you that's not true.

657
00:37:49,114 --> 00:37:51,818
We do not play politics
with a criminal investigation.

658
00:37:51,927 --> 00:37:54,222
And how do you explain
councilman Gray's allegations?

659
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:56,790
I think you should ask
councilman Gray that question.

660
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,443
Police! Search warrant!

661
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:06,839
Take the back.

662
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:08,221
On the ground, now!

663
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:09,522
Police! Search warrant!

664
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:10,722
Two upstairs.

665
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,188
- Don't move!
- Check that back room.

666
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:17,656
I said, get your ass on the ground.

667
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:18,818
- Get down!
- Get down!

668
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:30,867
This is the 1300 block, right?

669
00:38:30,988 --> 00:38:32,442
No, this is the 12.

670
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,021
Are we on the right corner?

671
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,723
- We had this as a stash house?
- According to the wiretap.

672
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:40,936
How long ago?
They move them around, you know.

673
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:49,721
Zeroes on the warrants.

674
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,713
Minor arrests on
the designated corners, sir.

675
00:38:51,773 --> 00:38:53,867
- They were tipped!
- You think?

676
00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:56,920
For us to come up this empty
at all these locations, It has to be.

677
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,136
This cocksucker Marlo
thinks he's smarter than us?

678
00:38:59,196 --> 00:39:00,255
He is not.

679
00:39:00,315 --> 00:39:02,065
Sergeant, I want to know
where he hangs.

680
00:39:02,145 --> 00:39:03,653
You mean like him personally?

681
00:39:04,345 --> 00:39:05,948
He moves around, Lieutenant.
He floats.

682
00:39:05,988 --> 00:39:08,212
But I have seen him in the
concrete park behind Fulton.

683
00:39:08,252 --> 00:39:09,815
- In a park?
- If the weather's right,

684
00:39:09,855 --> 00:39:11,723
he sits out there in
lawn chairs, holds court.

685
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:14,753
He's got people covering every approach
so there's no creeping up on him.

686
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:16,495
My guess is that he likes
to talk outdoors

687
00:39:16,536 --> 00:39:18,118
so no one can drop
a microphone on him.

688
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:20,392
Sergeant,
what can we do with that?

689
00:39:28,695 --> 00:39:30,778
I admit I've made some mistakes.

690
00:39:31,459 --> 00:39:33,403
Burrell being one of the biggest.

691
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:35,883
He's got a job
for about 10 more days.

692
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:40,328
After the primary, he's gone,
believe me.

693
00:39:40,786 --> 00:39:43,419
And that last stunt--
pulling a detective.

694
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:44,819
What'd you expect?

695
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,089
Not that.

696
00:39:47,947 --> 00:39:51,019
Hey. I had nothing to do
with that nonsense.

697
00:39:51,086 --> 00:39:52,419
Now, that's a straight-up lie.

698
00:39:52,485 --> 00:39:54,401
I was at that damn meeting
when you told him,

699
00:39:54,471 --> 00:39:56,004
"Slow the case down."

700
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:57,119
I didn't mean--

701
00:39:57,185 --> 00:39:59,910
Who the hell knows
what you mean anymore, Clarence?

702
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:01,951
Look at this.

703
00:40:03,397 --> 00:40:04,419
Look at it!

704
00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:07,765
You gave me your word on this.

705
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:10,218
Your word, Clarence.

706
00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:13,805
But here you are ticketed up
with Eunetta in her best precincts

707
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:16,417
and then ticketed up
with my girl Daniels,

708
00:40:16,477 --> 00:40:17,985
where she's running strong.

709
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,033
Odell, this is the first
I've seen this.

710
00:40:20,236 --> 00:40:23,676
Come on, now! This is probably
Eunetta's people pulling this shit.

711
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:26,345
With a "citizens for Royce"
authority line?

712
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:30,117
Look at you, Clarence.
Just look at you.

713
00:40:30,313 --> 00:40:33,750
You've forgotten your agenda.
You've forgotten your base.

714
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:36,792
You think a shave and some
Marcus Garvey posters

715
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,017
are gonna get you over?

716
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:40,431
Do you think that's gonna make up
for jumping in bed

717
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:42,079
with every damn developer?

718
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:46,085
Shit. You're even on
Clay Davis' tit.

719
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:49,117
Now, don't you go getting all
self-righteous with me, Odell.

720
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,436
Campaign runs on dollars.
You know it.

721
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:52,621
Whose dollars?

722
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:55,615
Those sons of bitches you got
around your card table every month

723
00:40:55,675 --> 00:40:56,793
feeding your kitty?

724
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:57,995
Oh, yeah.

725
00:40:58,592 --> 00:40:59,974
I know about that, too.

726
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:02,320
You-- trouble with you--

727
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,607
fuck you, Clarence.

728
00:41:04,749 --> 00:41:06,738
I'm gonna sit what's left
of this one out.

729
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,794
- I'm gonna sit it out.
- Sit it out.

730
00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:11,336
- The primary?
- Sit it out!

731
00:41:12,282 --> 00:41:13,285
Odell!

732
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:17,311
Who the hell do you
think you are, huh?

733
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:19,904
Come November, I'm still gonna
be the only game in town!

734
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:22,388
Odell, turn your back on me now,
I won't forget!

735
00:41:22,428 --> 00:41:23,816
We can't afford this.

736
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:26,831
We need his organization on Tuesday.
Go after him!

737
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:30,705
Fuck that holier-than-thou...
motherfucker!

738
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:33,205
Delegate Watkins.

739
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:35,328
Delegate Watkins!

740
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:37,302
Wait sir.

741
00:41:37,982 --> 00:41:40,717
I'm sure we can work this out.

742
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,982
You and the mayor can talk this out.

743
00:41:54,022 --> 00:41:55,264
Deputy Rawls, please.

744
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,783
It's Lieutenant Hoskins at the hall.

745
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:22,904
You're gonna use
the hole in the wall, right?

746
00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:25,628
Yeah, I'm gonna rub some dog
shit on the front of this thing.

747
00:42:25,728 --> 00:42:27,449
I don't want nobody touching it.

748
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:32,070
Got it?

749
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:43,113
You need to raise it a bit.

750
00:42:51,914 --> 00:42:53,912
Yeah, that's good.
Right there, that works.

751
00:42:58,477 --> 00:43:00,419
- Thought I heard something.
- Rats.

752
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:02,960
- How we doing?
- We need to go.

753
00:43:44,192 --> 00:43:46,991
He ain't nothing but a skanky-ass
bitch to begin with,

754
00:43:47,111 --> 00:43:50,006
and besides, he ex-police,
so you know what that like.

755
00:43:51,246 --> 00:43:52,810
I'm going to the ladies room.

756
00:43:52,976 --> 00:43:54,618
Bey, you need to talk to him.

757
00:43:59,521 --> 00:44:01,224
Yo, daddy,
don't even go there,

758
00:44:01,364 --> 00:44:04,428
with you all the time telling me
how you dropped out in the sixth grade,

759
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:06,432
went up on the corner
with Avon and Stringer.

760
00:44:06,472 --> 00:44:08,956
Earned cheese for the family,
saying how it made you a man--

761
00:44:09,016 --> 00:44:10,598
all right, all right.
You right.

762
00:44:10,908 --> 00:44:12,952
Can't throw rocks.
But I'm just saying.

763
00:44:13,158 --> 00:44:16,102
You know how your mother be,
with all the fussing.

764
00:44:16,243 --> 00:44:17,852
Maybe you just need
to slow it up.

765
00:44:17,912 --> 00:44:19,254
You know what I'm saying?

766
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,742
Yo, you heard
how Marlo punked Bodie?

767
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:24,243
Said he either got to work
for him or give up his corner.

768
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:26,342
Don't you know,
his sorry ass buckled.

769
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,813
You'd have gone about it different?

770
00:44:28,873 --> 00:44:30,952
Yeah, I'd have stood tall, like you.

771
00:44:31,593 --> 00:44:33,336
Got my 9. Fuck Chris and them.

772
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,884
Listen to you,
all spit and fire.

773
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:38,574
You'd have gone to the mattress
all by your lonesome

774
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,575
and went up against
half of the west side.

775
00:44:40,698 --> 00:44:42,101
You got it where it counts,

776
00:44:42,161 --> 00:44:44,207
and I respect that
more than anything.

777
00:44:44,344 --> 00:44:45,597
But shit out there now?

778
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:47,809
It ain't like it was
when we was coming up.

779
00:44:47,994 --> 00:44:49,271
Back in the day,

780
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:51,223
a punk nigger like Marlo steps out,

781
00:44:51,343 --> 00:44:52,756
breaking the rules and shit,

782
00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:54,837
he find himself in the back
of a car trunk

783
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:56,156
on the way to Leakin Park.

784
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:58,403
No doubt.
We did that shit right.

785
00:44:58,623 --> 00:44:59,885
Word was your bond.

786
00:45:00,026 --> 00:45:03,075
Man looked out for his own,
knowing he in a family.

787
00:45:03,324 --> 00:45:04,688
Dig where I'm coming from?

788
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,052
But today, it's all fucked up.

789
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:25,909
These steps.

790
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,276
Thank you, baby.

791
00:45:28,356 --> 00:45:29,607
You're good to go.

792
00:45:54,516 --> 00:45:56,379
Say "Omar."

793
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,502
Omar.

794
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:11,703
Nothing?

795
00:46:13,821 --> 00:46:15,388
We checked both
sides of the street

796
00:46:15,428 --> 00:46:16,817
from here up to Monroe.

797
00:46:16,897 --> 00:46:19,772
- Nothing?
- Nothing that don't belong in no sewer.

798
00:46:19,894 --> 00:46:20,976
Thanks.

799
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,092
Other ideas?

800
00:46:35,512 --> 00:46:38,677
Blood,
bump me off that nigger up the screen.

801
00:46:38,972 --> 00:46:40,599
Motherfucker in the Buick?

802
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,824
That be him.
I be saying,

803
00:46:42,938 --> 00:46:45,720
No motherfucker gonna run off
with my hair-ron.

804
00:46:46,105 --> 00:46:47,404
Oh, this is fucking great.

805
00:46:47,524 --> 00:46:51,004
Get somebody who reads lips,
this motherfucker's history.

806
00:46:51,169 --> 00:46:53,966
Is this legal? I mean,
intercepting what they're saying?

807
00:46:54,026 --> 00:46:55,388
Don't go Freamon on me.

808
00:46:58,234 --> 00:46:59,956
Shit. I got to run.

809
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:02,862
Hey, man, what about
some fucking relief?

810
00:47:02,922 --> 00:47:04,370
I been here all morning.

811
00:47:25,874 --> 00:47:27,116
You heard?

812
00:47:28,223 --> 00:47:29,605
They making movies.

813
00:47:29,904 --> 00:47:31,627
Yeah.
How you want to play it?

814
00:47:32,736 --> 00:47:35,160
I ain't sure.
Let's see the fat man.

815
00:47:37,324 --> 00:47:38,947
How'd the other thing turn out?

816
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:40,670
All good.

817
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:47,767
Yo.
What up, boy?

818
00:47:47,828 --> 00:47:49,740
- If you want some, I got Reese's.
- Nah, man.

819
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,353
You trying to make some real cheese?

820
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:53,215
- $5.00?
- What you need?

821
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:55,519
Me and Paul gonna get it on
with Tiff.

822
00:47:56,517 --> 00:47:57,527
Keep an eye out.

823
00:47:57,587 --> 00:47:59,368
I don't want Mrs. D creeping up.
Feel me?

824
00:47:59,435 --> 00:48:02,240
I feel you, but I got some sixth-graders
waiting on a special order.

825
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,301
Let them wait, man.

826
00:48:03,368 --> 00:48:05,268
It ain't like we gonna be all day.

827
00:48:09,717 --> 00:48:10,739
All right.

828
00:48:13,667 --> 00:48:14,954
No, ma'am, it says right here,

829
00:48:15,014 --> 00:48:18,601
His honor had the bureau of solid waste
conduct a clean sweep along Tivoly.

830
00:48:18,668 --> 00:48:20,402
<i>But it took 6 months</i>
<i>before they showed up.</i>

831
00:48:20,462 --> 00:48:22,537
Well, yeah, OK.
Well, nobody's perfect.

832
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:25,840
But, listen. I wouldn't be sitting here
If I didn't believe Clarence Royce

833
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,964
wasn't truly committed
to this city and its people.

834
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:29,543
<i>What about crime</i>
<i>in our neighborhood?</i>

835
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:31,426
I admit that's another good point.

836
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:34,049
But, lady, between you and me,

837
00:48:34,555 --> 00:48:36,178
I can tell from your voice
you're black

838
00:48:36,218 --> 00:48:38,041
and you can tell from my voice
I'm white.

839
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:39,428
So I got to ask you,

840
00:48:40,068 --> 00:48:42,768
when do you think the last time
a white man voted for a black man

841
00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:44,767
when there was
another white man in the race?

842
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,848
<i>I don't know, but you must</i>
<i>really believe in him.</i>

843
00:48:46,908 --> 00:48:50,173
Well, ain't that what I been saying?
He's just the best candidate.

844
00:48:50,465 --> 00:48:51,672
So you'll go with my man?

845
00:48:51,707 --> 00:48:52,714
<i>I'll think about it.</i>

846
00:48:52,768 --> 00:48:54,789
All right, that's great.
Thank you for your time.

847
00:48:54,828 --> 00:48:56,110
- <i>All right.</i>
- All right.

848
00:49:06,827 --> 00:49:07,889
I have a hall pass.

849
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:09,134
Yeah, good for you.

850
00:49:53,637 --> 00:49:54,778
Mine's down.

851
00:49:54,818 --> 00:49:55,980
Attaboy.

852
00:49:58,049 --> 00:49:59,612
You need bodies, Lester...

853
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:01,846
here you go.

854
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:08,108
We got a warrant and a teletype
for my boy Lex.

855
00:50:08,996 --> 00:50:11,640
So, dead or alive,
he's on file.

856
00:50:12,031 --> 00:50:15,797
And beyond that, it's time for you to
shine that mighty intellect of yours

857
00:50:16,215 --> 00:50:17,817
on some real murders.

858
00:50:17,998 --> 00:50:20,021
Give up the hypotheticals and shit.

859
00:50:20,964 --> 00:50:22,463
Yeah, I suppose.

860
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:26,611
This is my issue-- crime--

861
00:50:26,671 --> 00:50:29,230
and I understand completely
what you're saying,

862
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,005
and if you give me
the opportunity,

863
00:50:31,066 --> 00:50:32,998
I will be able to do something
to help you out

864
00:50:33,058 --> 00:50:35,402
and, you know, other people
in this neighborhood.

865
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,582
Mr. Ricks, thank you for your
time and for your attention.

866
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,713
- No problem.
- Thank you.

867
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,842
Thank you.

868
00:50:45,996 --> 00:50:47,304
Pretty brazen,

869
00:50:47,384 --> 00:50:49,507
shaking hands with the enemy
in broad daylight.

870
00:50:50,485 --> 00:50:51,796
Werner's deli, this isn't.

871
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,262
Definitely not.

872
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:55,729
Though here you are, councilman,
leaving no door unopened.

873
00:50:55,908 --> 00:50:57,562
Shoe leather--
our secret weapon.

874
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,996
You surprised me.
You've made this a horse race.

875
00:51:00,197 --> 00:51:02,786
So, ah, what makes me think
you didn't just happen by

876
00:51:02,846 --> 00:51:03,996
and find us here?

877
00:51:06,674 --> 00:51:08,617
Watkins is breaking with the mayor.

878
00:51:09,154 --> 00:51:10,275
How do you know?

879
00:51:11,224 --> 00:51:12,366
I know.

880
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:15,133
I've carried the mayor's water
because I had to, councilman.

881
00:51:15,213 --> 00:51:17,361
I'd love to see
some new blood in this city.

882
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,962
And I'd love the chance

883
00:51:19,261 --> 00:51:22,254
to do the right thing for this
police department for a change.

884
00:51:41,534 --> 00:51:43,497
Wait until he turns the corner.

885
00:51:47,724 --> 00:51:50,128
District office for Watkins.
Gilmor street.

886
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:52,412
And fuck them red lights, man,

887
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,514
not a place you expect
to find any gangsters.

888
00:52:03,326 --> 00:52:04,768
Police, for that matter.

889
00:52:06,592 --> 00:52:08,334
Heard you knew something I didn't.

890
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:09,853
Told you before,

891
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:13,127
I make it my business
to keep an ear to the ground.

892
00:52:13,323 --> 00:52:15,559
I make it my business
to do business.

893
00:52:15,767 --> 00:52:17,893
We doing business,
or are we just talking?

894
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:19,493
If it's talk, I'm-a walk.

895
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:21,878
I heard the people pulling
security at the card game

896
00:52:21,918 --> 00:52:23,900
weren't too keen on their wages.

897
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:26,270
Figured it was only a matter of time

898
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:29,513
before they found a way
to get their due compensation.

899
00:52:29,968 --> 00:52:31,511
And you didn't think to tell me?

900
00:52:32,173 --> 00:52:34,317
Man learns best
when he get burned.

901
00:52:35,484 --> 00:52:37,333
How do I know
you ain't making this shit up?

902
00:52:37,393 --> 00:52:39,797
You don't.
Things happen on the street.

903
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:42,143
Proof is hard to come by.

904
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:48,923
Go ahead, open it.

905
00:52:54,149 --> 00:52:56,993
Off the street,
there's all kind of proof.

906
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,794
They planning
on executing those Friday.

907
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,331
Time it with the election,
I guess,

908
00:53:02,654 --> 00:53:04,238
show they doing their job,

909
00:53:04,299 --> 00:53:06,937
cleaning up the city,
taking down a kingpin.

910
00:53:07,526 --> 00:53:08,758
How did you come by this?

911
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:11,570
Told you before,
I keep my ear to the ground.

912
00:53:11,924 --> 00:53:13,345
What are you gonna do with it?

913
00:53:13,783 --> 00:53:15,065
Maybe nothing.

914
00:53:15,655 --> 00:53:17,799
Charlie's not part of the co-op.

915
00:53:19,332 --> 00:53:21,355
Or maybe I tip him for a fee.

916
00:53:22,789 --> 00:53:25,131
What do you think a man
with a whole lot of money

917
00:53:25,191 --> 00:53:27,435
would pay for his freedom?

918
00:53:29,555 --> 00:53:31,398
You know, lately,

919
00:53:32,691 --> 00:53:35,323
I come to find out someone
trying to take pictures on me.

920
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:36,684
Pictures?

921
00:53:37,265 --> 00:53:38,267
Video.

922
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:41,456
You heard anything about me
through your travels?

923
00:53:42,885 --> 00:53:44,568
Had no incentive to listen.

924
00:53:48,542 --> 00:53:49,690
You do now.

925
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:06,749
It's one thing
to sit out the primary.

926
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:10,187
It's another for me
to turn on Clarence Royce.

927
00:54:10,888 --> 00:54:11,889
Granted.

928
00:54:11,956 --> 00:54:15,334
And if I did jump,
why not land behind Tony Gray?

929
00:54:16,364 --> 00:54:18,355
At least he's from
my side of the tracks.

930
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,924
Tony can't win.
I can.

931
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:25,917
Look. The truth is,
whatever I can do for you,

932
00:54:25,957 --> 00:54:28,040
the mayor can match or double.

933
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:30,324
I have a pretty good
grass roots organization,

934
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:32,523
but nothing even close
to his kind of money.

935
00:54:32,763 --> 00:54:35,021
Now, I'll ticket up
with anyone you want me to.

936
00:54:35,081 --> 00:54:38,206
I know you want Daniels in the 11th
and stokes in the 10th.

937
00:54:38,592 --> 00:54:41,154
I'll keep away from any tickets
you think I might harm.

938
00:54:41,273 --> 00:54:44,227
I know I'm not everyone's idea
of a bargain on your side of town.

939
00:54:45,251 --> 00:54:48,036
But right now,
a week from the primary,

940
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:51,706
the fact is,
Royce and I both need you.

941
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:53,788
After the election,

942
00:54:53,973 --> 00:54:56,755
the equation changes for him,
but not for me.

943
00:54:56,939 --> 00:54:59,521
I'm a white mayor
in a majority-black city,

944
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:01,118
and if I'm gonna do anything--

945
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:03,725
and, delegate, I am so serious
about fixing this city--

946
00:55:03,805 --> 00:55:06,054
I'm gonna have to govern by consensus.

947
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:09,258
And if you support me, you will have
a voice within my administration

948
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:11,092
simply because
I'm gonna need it.

949
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:16,802
Last poll that Clarence showed me,

950
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:19,271
he was up by 7 points.

951
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:22,768
Bullshit. I'm within 4.

952
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:29,821
You won't be needing that.

953
00:55:30,253 --> 00:55:31,353
I know.

954
00:55:34,172 --> 00:55:35,915
- Here?
- Yeah, here.

955
00:56:14,354 --> 00:56:15,416
Dag.

956
00:56:15,846 --> 00:56:18,430
Yo, turn it off.
The bulb might have got too hot.

957
00:56:18,847 --> 00:56:20,169
Or the batteries dying.

958
00:56:22,057 --> 00:56:23,299
We should go back.

959
00:56:27,347 --> 00:56:28,909
Yo, man, it stinks, man.

960
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:30,417
Ain't like it was.

961
00:56:45,053 --> 00:56:46,495
You see he ain't move.

962
00:56:50,271 --> 00:56:51,373
Yeah.

963
00:56:52,948 --> 00:56:54,531
Blood still stuck to his hair.

964
00:56:55,626 --> 00:56:56,748
He dead?

965
00:56:58,004 --> 00:56:59,086
He dead.

966
00:57:00,105 --> 00:57:01,287
Lex, too.

967
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:03,179
He dead. They all is.

968
00:57:04,647 --> 00:57:05,729
Feel better?

969
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:08,356
Donut wrong, yo.

970
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,777
Ain't no special dead.

971
00:57:13,962 --> 00:57:15,564
There's just dead.

972
00:57:36,552 --> 00:57:40,899
