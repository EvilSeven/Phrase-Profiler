1
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:10,470
Yo, Renaldo.

2
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:13,890
- Renaldo!
- Que?

3
00:01:13,926 --> 00:01:15,342
Next time you finish up
the box,

4
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:16,742
you need to holler on it, yo.

5
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:18,107
Si, si.

6
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,751
Yo mala mia.

7
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:02,067
Hey, y'all, it's Omar.

8
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,599
Omar.

9
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,021
There he is.

10
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:10,121
Omar step, yo.

11
00:02:10,188 --> 00:02:11,203
Omar, yo.

12
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:32,633
Y'all ain't got no honey nut?

13
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,208
Whatever you see.

14
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:40,426
An' a carton of newport.

15
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:42,338
Omar comin'.

16
00:02:44,091 --> 00:02:45,485
Hey, y'all, here he come.

17
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:53,962
Omar. Omar.

18
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:55,923
Omar strollin'.

19
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:51,649
They no have the honey nut?

20
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:57,322
I don't even want this, dog.

21
00:03:58,809 --> 00:03:59,812
Why not?

22
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,907
It ain't what you takin', it's who
you takin' it from. You feelin' me?

23
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:09,447
How you expect to run
with the wolves come night

24
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,668
when you spend all day
sportin' with the puppies?

25
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:16,778
4x03 - Home Room

26
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,911
So you stayin' with Royce, I see?

27
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:02,663
What you mean?

28
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:05,502
Oh, man.

29
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:10,637
Make sense, since I know
you got your fill of Carcetti.

30
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:12,935
They been puttin' up
a crop of these things

31
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:15,050
on every lawn on the block.

32
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:22,526
And as fast as I take 'em down,
they bring more.

33
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:25,103
That's what they
do this time of year.

34
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,136
I see you at your leisure.

35
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,311
I work 2 nights a week,
3 dayshifts,

36
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:34,470
and no weekends.

37
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:37,436
I'm off till this afternoon.

38
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:38,994
You good with it?

39
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:42,513
It ain't the Hopkins gig,
but it'll do.

40
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:47,579
Pullin' 52, good bennies,
got a take-home car.

41
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:51,604
I mean the hotel manager's
a pain in the ass, but still.

42
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:55,357
Well, if you was a bit free,
I heard something.

43
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:59,504
This thing over at university of
Maryland school of social work?

44
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,683
They got a grant. Big money.

45
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:02,925
Just stop.

46
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:05,638
Half a million to look at
repeat violent offenders.

47
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:08,071
Clinical intervention,
all that mess.

48
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,805
So, they gonna study some shit?

49
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:14,760
Melvin, I had me a good helping
of them downtown, tie-wearing,

50
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:18,813
come-to-do-good, stay-to-do-well
college-types last year.

51
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:19,841
You sure?

52
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:22,039
'Cause I sold 'em on it
should you want it.

53
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:24,673
Bunny, you a big man
down on the campus.

54
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:26,673
You the police that legalized it.

55
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:29,010
The college boys loved that mess.

56
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:30,479
Nobody else did, though.

57
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:33,540
Well, I tried.

58
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:37,739
You did.

59
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,240
Yo, blacktops, pandemic.

60
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,708
Pandemic.

61
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:47,992
Got that pandemic.

62
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:49,818
Pandemic.

63
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,508
Yo, my man, pandemic,
blacktops right here.

64
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,709
That's my boy, right?

65
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:09,763
Ain't take no handouts,
but he workin' for it.

66
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,576
See what I mean?

67
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:14,378
This nigga's made a little
something out this corner.

68
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,802
Now hold on, son.
We jus' talkin' now.

69
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:21,187
A'ight?

70
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,744
Man,
y'all did good with this spot.

71
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,466
You a rightful hustler.

72
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:29,677
What's your name again, man?
Boney? Ditty?

73
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,310
What was it now?

74
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,449
You know my name.

75
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,210
Yeah, but now here's the thing.

76
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:36,544
With this spot all built up an' shit?

77
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:38,644
We need it, yo. Yeah.

78
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:41,194
- What?
- 2 choices.

79
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:43,708
You can start takin' our
packages or you can step off.

80
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:46,328
My man Chris is gonna
holla at you, all right?

81
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:48,080
You tell him what it need to be.

82
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:53,013
Don't wait for the pandemic.
It's right here, y'all.

83
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,912
Don't sleep on the pandemic.

84
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,971
Wanna know more about
that boy right there.

85
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,978
Got good signs on him.

86
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:05,253
Big paws on a puppy, huh?

87
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:08,545
Yeah, big paws on a puppy.

88
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:09,983
To a "t."

89
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,979
Get that blacktop before you flop.

90
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:13,742
That pandemic.

91
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,215
The truth is we don't know
why he was killed.

92
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:19,446
Coulda had something to do
with him being a witness

93
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:21,587
or, it could be unrelated.

94
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:26,382
Now, whoever leaked that shit
to Carcetti's camp lied on us.

95
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:29,568
Yeah, well, that's it.

96
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,166
8 points--
Close as Carcetti gets.

97
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:37,147
He wants to go big dick with me?

98
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:39,120
I'll show him one he can't handle.

99
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,147
We put it out there:

100
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:43,520
anyone contributing to both sides

101
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:45,237
gets frozen outta my next term.

102
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:48,080
- No one rides the middle anymore.
- Done.

103
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:52,873
Next, I want D.P.W.
And H.C.D. out there today

104
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:55,164
tearing down all Carcetti signs.

105
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,755
Any lamppost, median,
any city-owned buildings--

106
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,613
unless the homeowner's
out there arguing, tear it down.

107
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:03,918
- Done.
- Third, I want transpo

108
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:06,583
camped outside
of Carcetti's headquarters.

109
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,896
Any car, any violation,
meter flag goes up,

110
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:12,850
inspection sticker-- tow it.

111
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,177
- Done.
- Next,

112
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:17,240
you 2...
slow it down.

113
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:21,006
Nothing else
comes out about that murder

114
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:23,075
until after the primary.

115
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:24,550
And I want both of you--

116
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:28,216
go to the press and talk down
that witness angle.

117
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,977
Take the full weight
either way it goes.

118
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,283
Clarence, I'm running
dead even with bond right now.

119
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,976
How you gonna be running
if I drop you from the ticket?

120
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:42,332
OK, that's it.
Thank you, gentlemen.

121
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:44,058
Go to it. Now.

122
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,831
Mr. Mayor?

123
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,672
- What?
- Carcetti has a point.

124
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,052
I went down to Annapolis,

125
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,285
got matching funds
for witness protection.

126
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:07,539
You didn't earmark a dime
to put 'em into play.

127
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:09,517
Next fiscal year.

128
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:12,223
Don't claim poverty on this.

129
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:14,122
We're only talking a quarter million.

130
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:17,449
I match those funds now
and that motherfucker Carcetti,

131
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:19,153
he's got a campaign highlight:

132
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:22,286
"Tommy Carcetti expands
witness protection program.

133
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:24,333
Fought for and won extra funds."

134
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:25,643
Hell with that!

135
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:28,821
I go after that state-match funds
after the election.

136
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:05,656
Naw, naw, I paid for 3 pills.

137
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,134
Look, blue shirt gets 2.

138
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:08,355
Naw, I get 2.

139
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:09,490
White shirt gets one.

140
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:11,452
- Cheatin' motherfucker.
- I get 4.

141
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:15,420
Look, blue shirt gets 2,
white one, no shirt one.

142
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,974
Now y'all can take what
y'all paid for and walk away

143
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,754
or just walk away with nothing.
Motherfuck a refund.

144
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:22,643
Naw, nigger, I paid for 3.

145
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:26,180
You need to re-think what putting
a hand on me's gonna get you.

146
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:30,794
You can thank your friend here
for snatching away y'all highs.

147
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:34,492
Yo, yo, hold up. Hold up.
Can I get my 2?

148
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:43,651
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

149
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:45,361
You don't rattle.

150
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:47,794
Yo, you come up
under my wing, young'un?

151
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:49,818
You ain't gonna do nothin'
but rise, man.

152
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:52,109
I don't even know why you
thinkin' about quittin'.

153
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,826
Look, man, like I already told you--

154
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,426
I'm all the way repaid,
and tomorrow's school.

155
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:59,236
Come on, man, what the fuck
you want to go to school for?

156
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:02,126
What do you want to be,
an astronaut?

157
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,752
A dentist?
A pay lawyer, nigger?

158
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:07,993
Look, check it out.

159
00:13:08,945 --> 00:13:10,997
Why don't you just
come down here after school

160
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,850
and just work these rush hours for me.

161
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:14,001
How 'bout that?

162
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:39,547
That's great. Thank you.
I know that kind of money...

163
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,770
I said I know that kind of money
doesn't come easy to anyone.

164
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:49,424
No, it's just something on my end here.
Some construction or something...

165
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:50,557
right.

166
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,150
Yeah, right. Thanks again.

167
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:55,716
2 hours, 30 grand.

168
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,054
Am I getting the hang of this or what?

169
00:13:59,156 --> 00:14:00,218
The fuck is that?

170
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:02,929
D.P.W. tearing up the sidewalk
right outside our door.

171
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,639
You really pissed him off.

172
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:07,534
Yes, I did, didn't I?

173
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:09,996
C'mon. Door-to-door in Irvington.

174
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:12,936
- Right.
- And we got that dead witness tonight.

175
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:34,229
Yeah. Federal?

176
00:14:36,498 --> 00:14:38,002
Naw, she ain't no federal.

177
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:40,187
That there a city girl.

178
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:43,492
I like shorty, too.
She all right.

179
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:45,619
Long as she don't get in my way.

180
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:51,077
Reup right there.

181
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,651
Por que?

182
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:55,600
School ain't start till
tomorrow, right?

183
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,366
Little one be all dressed up
with nowhere to go.

184
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:01,176
Yeah, you know it, too,
don't you, girl?

185
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,312
The camera?

186
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:07,356
- If you go in front, they gonna...
- they supposed to know it's me, man.

187
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:08,933
I'm my own trademark.
You feel me?

188
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,572
Si, but if they know it's you, then--

189
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,272
What, you scared on bein' made?

190
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:14,103
Claro que si.

191
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,576
How 'bout I put you in one
of them full-body Bunny suits?

192
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,268
Be like a 6-foot rabbit
puttin' a pistol in they face.

193
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:40,585
Let me get a pack of juicy Fruit.

194
00:15:52,302 --> 00:15:55,003
You like one of them
half-soul, half-Chinese types.

195
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,407
From Vietnam and shit.

196
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,413
Come again now, Mama-San.

197
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,344
Patience, girl.

198
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,150
Mo' patience.

199
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:29,427
The guy drives a shitbox,
he's got a 2-bit mini-mart,

200
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:31,903
but the back door in there
is reinforced steel

201
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:34,641
and the security camera
on the street is high-end.

202
00:16:35,172 --> 00:16:37,451
Not only that, but I think
I made the reup today.

203
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,181
Schoolgirl with a heavy backpack.

204
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:45,336
I pulled Andre's phone history
trying to find Marlo's organization,

205
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,740
cross-referencing D.N.R.S
to other cells.

206
00:16:47,913 --> 00:16:50,073
This is Fruit, this is Monk,

207
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:52,191
and there's 3 or 4
other good probables.

208
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:54,939
Not likely to find a direct
line to Marlo that way.

209
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:57,273
Andre had to go through Monk
to get to him.

210
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,507
No. But we might get
a cell on Chris Partlow

211
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:01,875
or for Tote or for one
of the top Lieutenants.

212
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:03,092
We're gettin' close.

213
00:17:04,363 --> 00:17:05,743
Deputy pulled me downtown.

214
00:17:05,862 --> 00:17:07,553
You guys aren't into any shit, are you?

215
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:08,679
No, sir.

216
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:15,174
Good he wasn't down
at the ocean today.

217
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:19,873
And the subpoenas?

218
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:22,904
You won't see a page of anything
until after the primary.

219
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,008
After that, if a document lands
and there's no one there to read it,

220
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,609
will the mayor and his people
honestly give a shit?

221
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:30,466
Other than that,
what can I tell you

222
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,165
except to get that unit back
on the street where it belongs.

223
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:37,043
Lieutenant,

224
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:39,769
you are relieved
from command of major crimes.

225
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:42,137
You've done exceptional work,

226
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:44,722
and in light of that,
we want you to improve the performance

227
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:46,492
of another vital aspect of our mission.

228
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,421
- Sir?
- Telephone reporting unit.

229
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:50,846
You report there tomorrow 0800.

230
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:54,353
Have I done something wrong?

231
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:57,220
Lieutenant Marimow will
be taking over major crimes.

232
00:17:57,751 --> 00:17:59,875
If you need to brief him,
do so promptly.

233
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:03,726
Yes, sir.

234
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,920
Jimmy, how's that beach house coming?

235
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:10,028
Beach... fine, sir.

236
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:12,345
Great. Sounds great.

237
00:18:21,828 --> 00:18:23,527
Yeah, hand me the colander, will ya?

238
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,035
- He's early.
- Yeah.

239
00:18:28,318 --> 00:18:30,146
You get the door. I'll do that.

240
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:34,279
- Hey.
- Hey.

241
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,348
Come in.

242
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,314
Smells good.

243
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:39,746
Spaghetti. Nothing fancy.

244
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:40,822
Cote du rhone.

245
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:43,313
Yeah, sommelier behind
the plexi said it was dry.

246
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,058
Hey, Beadie.

247
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,696
Hey, Bunk, how ya doin'?

248
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:49,127
Look at you. Blonde and all.

249
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:53,347
- You like it?
- I do. I do. Hey, kids.

250
00:18:53,414 --> 00:18:55,668
This is Jack, that's Kari.
This is Detective Moreland.

251
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:56,844
- Hi.
- Hi!

252
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:58,979
- Call me Bunk.
- Let me open this wine.

253
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:01,525
Yeah, that's right.
Let that shit breathe.

254
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:04,715
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:07,175
- That's all right. They hear worse.
- Yeah, no doubt.

256
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:08,833
So, you want ice in yours?

257
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,047
No, man, that's a double-digit vino.

258
00:19:11,436 --> 00:19:12,554
Even has a cork.

259
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:14,254
So.

260
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,822
I like your binders.

261
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:21,242
- Thanks.
- McNulty gave them to us.

262
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:22,849
- McNulty?
- Yeah.

263
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:24,215
- Not Jimmy?
- No.

264
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:25,386
Uncle Jimmy? Jim?

265
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:27,117
- Jim?
- No.

266
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:28,948
No?
Daddy? Pops?

267
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,915
McNulty.

268
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,325
Oh, just plain McNulty.

269
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:38,296
An' if I take his weak-ass product,

270
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:40,893
that mean I'm gonna be
makin' less money. Know what I'm sayin'?

271
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,889
Only reason I could bring
any life to this strip

272
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:45,119
is because of the good shit
that y'all was givin' me.

273
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:46,853
And then I'm standing here
like a asshole

274
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:49,809
holding my Charles Dickens
'Cause I ain't got no muscle, no backup.

275
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:52,567
Shit, man.
Yo, if this was the old days?

276
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,320
Yeah, now, well,
the thing about the old days?

277
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,413
They the old days.

278
00:19:58,102 --> 00:19:59,890
People I'm working with now?

279
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:04,785
So you want to bump
with Marlo over real estate?

280
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,171
You're on your own.
But, if you want my advice?

281
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:10,372
I don't, man. I don't.

282
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,519
Bodie. Yo, Bodie.

283
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:19,460
Me? I lost the wholesale to
every crew in Winchester homes.

284
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,784
Them horses takin' Marlo's shit now.

285
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:25,878
He pushin' the independents
over hilltop, too.

286
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:28,684
I lost 3 crews there this month.

287
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:30,573
What about the eastside?

288
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:32,586
There we got a much bigger problem:

289
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:34,770
All those ugly-ass bitches
in Yankee hats

290
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:36,246
chasin' all the locals away.

291
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,866
I heard them New York boys
ran off most of Delroy's people,

292
00:20:38,954 --> 00:20:41,280
and those that stay
gotta take they package.

293
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:44,264
Man, all this theorizing
about how it be product,

294
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:45,888
not territory?

295
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,157
You can't talk that shit

296
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:49,104
if a nigga snatchin'
all of the territory

297
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:50,663
an' won't take none of your product.

298
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,354
See, the thing is Marlo's
only takin' a little bite.

299
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,821
Them New York cats is like
Wal-Mart comin' to town.

300
00:20:56,946 --> 00:21:00,155
Me, personally,
I think it's time Wal-Mart went home.

301
00:21:00,644 --> 00:21:03,310
If we gonna bump with 'em,
it's got to be all of us.

302
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:04,388
I tell you what?

303
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:06,446
I'd like to see Marlo
with us in on that one.

304
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,188
You know what I mean?
One big Baltimore team.

305
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:12,123
Yeah, Marlo can make an
inconvenient nigga disappear,

306
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:13,181
can't he?

307
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:17,707
I heard he got some kinda hookup
at this funeral home in Westport.

308
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,514
Coffin goes in there
needs 2 pallbearer.

309
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:23,239
Come out,
you need 8 to carry that bitch,

310
00:21:23,311 --> 00:21:24,905
- you know what I mean?
- Nah, nah.

311
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:26,790
He usin' them shut-up rowhouses.

312
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,656
Dump a body in there,
no one can tell one smell from another.

313
00:21:31,286 --> 00:21:34,578
Well, whatever he doin',
he cold, but he ain't stupid.

314
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:39,516
Think it's time to try again
to talk to the boy.

315
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,472
I hope you got better
shit to say than Stringer

316
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:46,174
'cause young'un ain't given
no one an ear yet.

317
00:21:49,844 --> 00:21:52,056
Dag, Jimmy, you're
a domesticated motherfucker.

318
00:21:52,117 --> 00:21:53,436
Yeah, I guess I am.

319
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,024
Yeah, we're good.

320
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,832
How's everything at the port?

321
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:57,955
Quiet.

322
00:21:58,221 --> 00:21:59,998
It's quiet everywhere.
Even the western.

323
00:22:00,113 --> 00:22:01,107
Yeah.

324
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:04,542
I'm having a hard time with it, though.
Somethin' ain't right.

325
00:22:04,577 --> 00:22:05,976
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.

326
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:07,038
You working something?

327
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:08,978
Yeah, I got this one case.

328
00:22:09,951 --> 00:22:12,090
I know who the shooter is
but can't find him.

329
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:13,253
He'll turn up.

330
00:22:14,705 --> 00:22:15,802
Maybe.

331
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:17,667
More?

332
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:19,397
Oh, mercy. No, ma'am.

333
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,850
Dessert?

334
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:23,860
I was thinking,
we might go out for a little taste.

335
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,013
'Less you got to tuck in the kids.

336
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:28,358
I don't know.

337
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:30,059
Oh, it's fine, Jimmy. You go.

338
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:31,184
I'll tuck 'em in.

339
00:22:36,976 --> 00:22:38,157
She trusts you.

340
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:39,733
Yeah.

341
00:22:46,118 --> 00:22:48,445
Can't go to dinner
without catching a page?

342
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:49,986
What now?

343
00:22:50,553 --> 00:22:53,608
Her John jumps in the shower.
She rummages his wallet.

344
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:56,366
He figures it out
and beats on her

345
00:22:56,472 --> 00:22:58,927
till the people next-door
call the front desk.

346
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,550
Sir, if she doesn't
have the money on her,

347
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:25,089
I don't know what I can do.

348
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:27,523
Did you beat that woman in there?

349
00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:29,497
I just want my money back.

350
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:30,731
Excuse me, Mr. Gergen.

351
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:33,264
I need a moment with
my director of security.

352
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:41,030
If she presses charges,
I'm cuffin' that motherfucker.

353
00:23:41,097 --> 00:23:43,635
- Mr. Colvin, this is a delicate matter.
- Delicate? Shit.

354
00:23:43,706 --> 00:23:46,365
Mr. Gergen represents
a national consortium

355
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,157
of convention planners,
and he's been a friend of the hotel--

356
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,607
Mr. Colvin? Mr. Colvin?

357
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:54,231
Now, you took his cash
and he beat you good, huh?

358
00:23:54,528 --> 00:23:55,873
How much he beat you for?

359
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:00,552
How much?

360
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:09,799
Give me the cuffs.

361
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:14,218
No, Mr. Colvin. I...

362
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:18,649
What the fuck is this?

363
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:21,312
She steals my money,
and you're gonna lock me up?

364
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:22,970
You're gettin' charged with assault.

365
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,966
You wanna charge her with the theft,
I'll put the cuffs on her, too.

366
00:24:26,037 --> 00:24:29,134
- But you in a wagon, shitbird.
- Mr. Colvin, this is not acceptable.

367
00:24:29,294 --> 00:24:30,600
No. He's goin' in a wagon.

368
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,329
Mr. Colvin, I have to insist.

369
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:33,862
30 years a police officer.

370
00:24:33,915 --> 00:24:35,473
I never took cuffs off a right charge.

371
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:36,554
Ain't about to start now.

372
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:38,630
You're not a police officer,
Mr. Colvin.

373
00:24:40,252 --> 00:24:41,420
You work for us.

374
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,017
Naw, I'm good.

375
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:44,319
You nursin' that thing
like a baby bird.

376
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:49,826
You know those little
corner joints in the ghetto

377
00:25:49,914 --> 00:25:53,677
that sell subs,
and fried chicken, lake trout?

378
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:57,317
Lake trout.

379
00:25:58,705 --> 00:26:00,599
Like egg creams in New York.

380
00:26:00,948 --> 00:26:02,152
No eggs, no cream.

381
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:03,214
Exactly.

382
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:04,841
No lake, no trout.

383
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,719
They're pogies.
White fish, trash fish.

384
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:11,995
Exactly. White trash fish.

385
00:26:13,953 --> 00:26:15,773
I mean, "lake trout."
That's all marketing.

386
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,240
It's just all dressed up
like something it ain't.

387
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:23,726
You know what I'm sayin'?

388
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:29,107
Sometimes it is what it is.

389
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,007
It really is.

390
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:37,423
That's deep.

391
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:42,719
I like the way you think.

392
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,047
Yeah, you, too.

393
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:53,376
Hold on.

394
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:56,183
Dang, Bug,

395
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,810
if you can tie one shoe,
you can tie the other one.

396
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:00,576
You hear me?

397
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:03,202
Cookies all on your face.

398
00:27:04,146 --> 00:27:05,314
Come on.

399
00:27:10,143 --> 00:27:12,177
What up, shorty?
Ready for the first day?

400
00:27:12,557 --> 00:27:15,777
Yeah, he can't wait to be in
the third grade. Ain't that right, bug?

401
00:27:16,794 --> 00:27:17,792
'Sup?

402
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,217
Dukie.

403
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:26,803
Cool.

404
00:27:36,536 --> 00:27:39,757
Look at all these big-ass
eighth graders out here.

405
00:27:40,378 --> 00:27:43,122
Look like some sixth-graders
gonna get banked.

406
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:45,626
Yo, come in here.
I wanna show y'all somethin'.

407
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,045
Go ahead, Bug.

408
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:50,279
Yo, what up, boy?
That Jersey's crazy, son.

409
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:51,858
Where you get that at?

410
00:28:01,061 --> 00:28:02,052
Yo, check it.

411
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:04,214
This dude in the joint
with my father drew these.

412
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:05,545
I'm about to get one on my arm.

413
00:28:05,598 --> 00:28:07,780
Is this you?
Why would you get yourself on your arm?

414
00:28:07,847 --> 00:28:09,447
In case you forget
what you look like?

415
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:10,815
Yo, what do these mean, man?

416
00:28:10,882 --> 00:28:12,794
A'ight, this one means "heart,"

417
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:14,376
like, you know, "he got heart."

418
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:16,568
- And that means "lion."
- How you know that?

419
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:18,090
Word, the dude could be playing you.

420
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:19,706
Like, this one,
instead of "heart,"

421
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,776
it could mean like
"bitch" or something.

422
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:25,619
And like this one,
it could mean like "pussy" or "clown."

423
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,846
Come on, man.
Fuck y'all motherfuckers.

424
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:28,926
They probably do, too.

425
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:30,058
Man, get outta my house.

426
00:28:30,147 --> 00:28:31,448
Understand something about me.

427
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,742
I may be wearing these bars,
but I worked the bricks to earn 'em,

428
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,739
and I am stone cold police first,
last, and always.

429
00:28:42,215 --> 00:28:43,715
Froze my balls off in the winter,

430
00:28:43,782 --> 00:28:46,337
sweated 'em in the summer,
ran, jumped,

431
00:28:46,585 --> 00:28:50,415
rolled in the dirt
with the bad guys 24/7/365.

432
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:53,452
Now, I'm a great admirer of this unit.

433
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:54,994
Avon Barksdale?

434
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,393
That was a 14-point buck you bagged.

435
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,082
However,
we are gonna do better.

436
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,841
And if there's a case
to be made out there,

437
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:05,334
we'll make it together

438
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:09,216
With good work and good
supervision of that work.

439
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:13,452
I want to be briefed
every step of the way.

440
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:15,717
Questions?

441
00:29:19,964 --> 00:29:20,973
No?

442
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,552
Good.

443
00:29:35,376 --> 00:29:36,373
Yo, who you got?

444
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:40,250
I got... Prez...
Prez... what?

445
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,017
I got Mrs. Scott.
Fuckin' hate that foul bitch, man.

446
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:47,393
Man, she ain't that bad.
At least you ain't got Sampson.

447
00:29:47,446 --> 00:29:48,403
Yeah, I know.

448
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:49,712
Yo, Michael, who you got?

449
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:58,672
Presborowski?
Pres...

450
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:01,620
yo, he new and white.
We got it made.

451
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:15,110
Look at this.

452
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,187
Where is your fine take-home car?

453
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:21,817
Got took home.

454
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,128
We need to talk.

455
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:54,008
Sixth-grade is on the first floor.

456
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:56,390
Seventh-grade is on the second.

457
00:30:56,457 --> 00:31:00,290
Eighth-grade homeroom
is on the third floor.

458
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:02,989
Don't go up the down staircase.

459
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:05,424
Quickly and quietly, people.

460
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:08,137
I see you, Quantell.

461
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:09,413
I see you, too.

462
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:13,191
School's getting ready to start.
Come on.

463
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,180
Hi, dear.
Good to see you back.

464
00:31:17,215 --> 00:31:19,144
Yo, what up, Turner.
You back for more?

465
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,883
Aw, damn, man.
I love the first day, son.

466
00:31:22,954 --> 00:31:24,807
Everybody all friendly an' shit.

467
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:27,586
Namond Brice.
Already, we're starting?

468
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,425
Damn, man.

469
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:38,259
Next time, they stay in my drawer.

470
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:39,674
Yo, whatever, man.

471
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:42,289
I know, right? Already, son.

472
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:47,192
This case is crazy, son.

473
00:31:49,348 --> 00:31:51,649
I know, right?
We're seventh graders.

474
00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:10,993
Yo, dag. You see Neesy?

475
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,094
Yo, them bitches is on steroids, word.

476
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:15,961
Word, son.
Send them bitches to Iran.

477
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:17,720
That shit'd be over in a heartbeat.

478
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,848
- OK, check the chart
to see where you're sitting.

479
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:31,541
Check the chart.

480
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:33,942
Hi, I'm Randy.

481
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:35,924
How are you doing, Randy?

482
00:32:40,565 --> 00:32:41,804
Check the chart.

483
00:32:54,436 --> 00:32:55,692
OK. Good morning.

484
00:32:58,747 --> 00:33:00,199
OK, good morning.

485
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:02,692
Yo! Shut up!

486
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:08,178
Good morning.

487
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:11,031
I'm your homeroom teacher,
obviously.

488
00:33:11,097 --> 00:33:13,264
My name is Mr. Pryzbylewski.

489
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:16,142
But you can call me
Mr. Pryzbylewski.

490
00:33:23,064 --> 00:33:24,905
OK. Let's find out who you are.

491
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:27,828
<i>This is Mrs. Donnelly.</i>

492
00:33:27,863 --> 00:33:29,608
<i>Teachers,</i>
<i>we had trouble with first bells,</i>

493
00:33:29,643 --> 00:33:32,319
<i>so expect the class change</i>
<i>to ring in one minute.</i>

494
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,767
<i>Students will walk, not run,</i>
<i>to classes in an orderly manner.</i>

495
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:44,633
OK, we'll, get to
know each other a little later.

496
00:33:57,673 --> 00:34:00,097
Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

497
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:01,653
Latifah.

498
00:34:04,863 --> 00:34:05,901
Sorry.

499
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:12,725
Where my bus passes at?

500
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:15,529
Crystal Judkins, you're not listed.

501
00:34:15,582 --> 00:34:17,924
Crystal?
I look like crystal to you?

502
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:19,734
I'm Charlene.

503
00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:23,397
Ronald Parker?

504
00:34:23,804 --> 00:34:26,101
Karim Williams.
Ronald over there.

505
00:34:27,422 --> 00:34:28,570
Ah, geez.

506
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:31,002
Yo, Mr. Prez, I need
a hall pass for the bathroom.

507
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,077
It's an emergency.

508
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:34,069
Everyone. I need
those bus passes back.

509
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,167
Hold on.
Everyone, stay where you are.

510
00:34:38,651 --> 00:34:40,354
Stay where--
I need those passes back.

511
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:42,200
It's an emergency.
Mr. Prez...

512
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,671
everyone, I need
those bus passes back.

513
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:45,803
The kids that need them...

514
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:46,871
- Mr. Prez...
- What?

515
00:34:46,938 --> 00:34:48,877
- Just take one.
- I need those bus passes...

516
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,000
No one leaves this room

517
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,618
Until Mr. Pryzbylewski
gets those bus passes back.

518
00:34:54,771 --> 00:34:56,427
Do I need to say that twice?

519
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:00,949
Thank you.

520
00:35:01,588 --> 00:35:02,792
Thank you.

521
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,437
You'll get the hang of it.

522
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:34,239
<i>Come in.</i>

523
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:39,140
<i>Are you coming in or what?</i>

524
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:40,913
I'm coming in, OK?

525
00:35:54,197 --> 00:35:55,648
You asked to see me, sir?

526
00:35:56,162 --> 00:35:57,241
I did.

527
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:09,714
Seeing as how I like
to know my boys in depth:

528
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:11,812
why'd you want this unit?

529
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:14,384
Honestly?

530
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:18,387
I took the sergeant's test,
scored pretty high,

531
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:21,386
but not high enough,
and Lieutenant Hoskins,

532
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:23,040
we went through
the academy together.

533
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:25,009
He said that this--
This is a good detail

534
00:36:25,076 --> 00:36:26,396
for going up the ladder.

535
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:29,614
I mean I know you
have to do it for a while,

536
00:36:29,705 --> 00:36:32,257
but maybe next year,
if I do good here,

537
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:34,735
they'll reach down for me.

538
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:37,576
Next year?

539
00:36:38,143 --> 00:36:40,637
I mean, for some things,
that's a long time to wait.

540
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,711
Excuse me?

541
00:36:45,355 --> 00:36:46,711
I hear you're a good cop.

542
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:49,370
I also hear you recognize
who your friends are

543
00:36:50,414 --> 00:36:51,911
and that you're loyal to them.

544
00:36:52,058 --> 00:36:53,344
Did I hear all that right?

545
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,609
Absolutely.

546
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,006
Where are you on the list?

547
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:04,351
32. They took 15, but--

548
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:07,206
30-- man, I thought you were
gonna say something like 60,

549
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:09,277
or, u know, 95.

550
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:15,209
Let me call my man,
Burrell.

551
00:37:15,774 --> 00:37:19,271
No need in wasting good police like you
chauffeuring around politicians.

552
00:37:19,455 --> 00:37:21,264
I don't even know
what to say, Mr. Mayor.

553
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:24,043
This-- This is unexpected.

554
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,458
Don't mention it.

555
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:31,531
Today being the first day,
let's have some fun.

556
00:37:32,254 --> 00:37:34,226
I'm gonna throw you
a little math puzzle,

557
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:36,667
see if I can get you
thinking on your feet.

558
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,247
Andre is leaving Baltimore...

559
00:37:40,314 --> 00:37:42,881
Mr. Prezbo,
I need to change my seat

560
00:37:42,948 --> 00:37:45,041
'cause this boy here
smells like a garbage can.

561
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:49,911
All right, you need to work a little
on your compassion skills.

562
00:37:49,964 --> 00:37:52,748
Yeah, he needs to work a little
on his soap and water skills.

563
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:57,747
All right, like I was saying.

564
00:37:58,373 --> 00:38:00,302
My friend Andre
is leaving Baltimore.

565
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,548
He's going 60 miles an hour...

566
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:05,248
hey, what side
of Baltimore, east or west?

567
00:38:05,802 --> 00:38:07,130
It doesn't make
any difference.

568
00:38:07,183 --> 00:38:08,308
That's what you think.

569
00:38:10,427 --> 00:38:11,666
OK, east.

570
00:38:14,346 --> 00:38:17,089
West, west, OK?

571
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,639
OK.

572
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:23,234
And he's going,
to Philadelphia...

573
00:38:23,304 --> 00:38:24,437
man, Philly's ass.

574
00:38:24,892 --> 00:38:27,246
- Yo, you think Allen Iverson is ass?
- OK, stop.

575
00:38:27,317 --> 00:38:29,237
Yo, he only play for them.
He ain't from there.

576
00:38:29,286 --> 00:38:31,922
Hey, I never play for the sixers
no matter how much they pay me.

577
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,617
Nigga, they'd pay yo' ass to go away.

578
00:38:34,684 --> 00:38:35,685
Enough.

579
00:38:38,265 --> 00:38:41,518
OK, Andre's leaving Baltimore,
west Baltimore,

580
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:43,691
traveling 60 miles per hour.

581
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:46,751
He's going to Philadelphia
which is 80 miles away.

582
00:38:46,818 --> 00:38:48,976
- What kind of car?
- Hey, he drivin' on I-95,

583
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:50,804
he need to watch out
for the state police.

584
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,184
They be profilin' niggas.

585
00:38:52,962 --> 00:38:54,785
He ain't say Andre was black, yo.

586
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:57,490
C'mon, Randy. Andre?
From the westside?

587
00:38:57,525 --> 00:39:00,066
- Hey, he ain't say he was black.
- Yo, you know he black.

588
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,085
OK. OK.

589
00:39:02,152 --> 00:39:04,119
I said OK!

590
00:39:04,306 --> 00:39:06,837
Mr. Prezbo.
You say he travelin' in a car.

591
00:39:07,085 --> 00:39:09,581
Is he driving?
Or is he like in the back seat?

592
00:39:09,786 --> 00:39:12,529
All right, you know what?
Fun is fun...

593
00:39:26,691 --> 00:39:28,178
Take your seats!

594
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,259
Everybody sit down!

595
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:38,154
Everything OK in here?

596
00:39:50,476 --> 00:39:52,229
Why isn't Officer Massey present?

597
00:39:53,379 --> 00:39:55,113
Working overnight on the wire.

598
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:58,058
Attendance at all office
meetings is now mandatory.

599
00:39:58,111 --> 00:39:59,315
Inform her.

600
00:40:01,904 --> 00:40:04,596
And this Marlo Stanfield?
This is the best we can do?

601
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:06,528
- Sir?
- This is the guy,

602
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,648
we're wasting months
chasing with a wiretap?

603
00:40:08,692 --> 00:40:11,259
We could be on the street doing
a dozen other different things.

604
00:40:11,294 --> 00:40:12,514
Stanfield is a comer.

605
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,957
He's got a lot of westside real estate.

606
00:40:15,134 --> 00:40:16,462
How many bodies on him?

607
00:40:18,288 --> 00:40:20,314
He fought a war against
the Barksdales last year

608
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:22,119
and dropped a few,
but nothing recent.

609
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,234
Nothing recent?

610
00:40:23,305 --> 00:40:25,924
He owns west Baltimore
but with no bodies?

611
00:40:26,346 --> 00:40:28,665
Maybe it's just me,
but in 18 years out there,

612
00:40:28,754 --> 00:40:31,054
I have never seen
a carnivore eat a carrot.

613
00:40:31,108 --> 00:40:32,557
He's been quiet for a time--

614
00:40:32,624 --> 00:40:34,796
For a time?
This city's up to its hips in blood

615
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,258
and you are sitting on
one guy with a history?

616
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,391
OK, here's the new world order, guys.

617
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:42,801
I want good, quick rips.

618
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:45,507
6, 10, 12 felony cases a month.

619
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,991
That means no more long-ass wiretaps,
no more subpoenas,

620
00:40:49,204 --> 00:40:50,625
no more mincing around on shit.

621
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:53,030
We get out on the street
and come back with stats.

622
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,682
The Barksdale case is closed,

623
00:40:56,184 --> 00:40:58,547
and when the Stanfield wire
comes up for another 30 days,

624
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,426
we close out on that
as well. Understood?

625
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:01,759
You know, to hell with this.

626
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:05,496
We got a wiretap up,
and a judge decides when it comes down.

627
00:41:07,155 --> 00:41:08,518
Well, Detective,

628
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:11,912
the deputy ops is gonna
talk to you about that.

629
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:33,923
Table b. put away
those cards away.

630
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,300
Kareem Myers. Sit down.

631
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:40,428
Yo, yo, list, listen.

632
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:44,963
Kit kats a dollar,
Snicker bars a dollar,

633
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:47,012
Warheads a dollar,
Twizzlers a dollar.

634
00:41:47,295 --> 00:41:49,362
Man, sour patch 50 cent,
and gum 50 cent.

635
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:57,187
Anything you
can get at the store,

636
00:41:57,293 --> 00:41:58,729
I can get in here for y'all.

637
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:01,052
- Gummi bears?
- Gummi bears?

638
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:02,381
Ain't a problem.

639
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,874
I got Snickers, M&Ms.

640
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:07,662
Check this price and come holla at me.
I'm runnin' a 3 for 2 discount,

641
00:42:07,698 --> 00:42:09,514
and I'm taking personal
orders for tomorrow.

642
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:12,063
- I'll be here tomorrow.
- So if you want something special,

643
00:42:12,098 --> 00:42:13,407
just come holla at me.

644
00:42:16,179 --> 00:42:17,489
There it is, yo.

645
00:42:24,444 --> 00:42:26,598
Que pena mierda.
Why not give me a water pistol?

646
00:42:26,656 --> 00:42:29,072
Hey, yo, Renaldo, you just
remember about how we gonna do.

647
00:42:29,107 --> 00:42:30,258
It'll play.

648
00:42:44,281 --> 00:42:46,198
Oye, gordo. The package.

649
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:47,907
Avanza, cabron!

650
00:42:48,173 --> 00:42:51,198
With that raggedy-ass piece?
Nigga, is you crazy?

651
00:42:51,265 --> 00:42:52,256
Loco or something?

652
00:42:52,312 --> 00:42:53,889
Don't you know the shit is bulletproof?

653
00:42:53,942 --> 00:42:55,021
You don't understand--

654
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:01,299
You heard what the boy said.

655
00:43:10,058 --> 00:43:11,368
A box of newports.

656
00:43:20,862 --> 00:43:22,438
Where my change, yo?

657
00:43:23,796 --> 00:43:24,893
Don't wild me.

658
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:37,219
Hey, yo, you see the look on his mug?

659
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:40,069
That's the reason why
we get up every morning.

660
00:43:49,384 --> 00:43:52,686
Now, Andre's friend Yvonne

661
00:43:52,721 --> 00:43:55,005
Is supposed to meet him
in Philadelphia.

662
00:43:55,058 --> 00:43:57,132
- Yeah.
- Andre gonna bone that skank.

663
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,344
Can you please shut up?

664
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,196
Mr. Prezbo is tryin'
to teach us somethin'.

665
00:44:00,232 --> 00:44:02,386
You shut up, bitch.
He ain't teachin' me nothin'.

666
00:44:03,136 --> 00:44:05,597
Yvonne, though,
is coming from New York.

667
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:09,203
So...
my question for you is--

668
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:18,185
A, who arrived in Philly
first, Andre or Yvonne?

669
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,893
And B, by how much time?

670
00:44:23,123 --> 00:44:27,194
And C... who gives a rat's ass?

671
00:44:29,682 --> 00:44:31,848
With this grant, the mandate
is not only to rethink

672
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,394
the way we utilize institutions,

673
00:44:33,748 --> 00:44:36,508
but to help us start getting
past having to rely on jail

674
00:44:36,614 --> 00:44:39,105
and drug rehab as our only responses.

675
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:42,105
We're looking for a specific
target group to inoculate,

676
00:44:42,415 --> 00:44:43,867
epidemiologically speaking...

677
00:44:43,902 --> 00:44:46,739
doctor, pardon me,
I'm not an academic.

678
00:44:47,009 --> 00:44:48,205
Not by a long shot. But,

679
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:53,039
what exactly are you--
are you saying here?

680
00:44:53,106 --> 00:44:55,989
He's sayin' he's got a lot of
money to come up with some way

681
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,040
to go at those boys out there
bangin' on the corners.

682
00:44:59,164 --> 00:45:00,580
That's what I mean, yes.

683
00:45:00,927 --> 00:45:02,537
So where do I come in?

684
00:45:02,608 --> 00:45:04,608
Well, if the salary
arrangements are suitable,

685
00:45:04,643 --> 00:45:07,837
your duties would be to perform
as a field researcher,

686
00:45:08,262 --> 00:45:11,174
A liaison operating in the,
urban environment.

687
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:13,844
You go out in the 'hood

688
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:16,173
and get him some
corner boys to mess with.

689
00:45:17,022 --> 00:45:19,156
See? This is why
I need somebody like you

690
00:45:19,192 --> 00:45:20,377
to be paired up with me.

691
00:45:20,435 --> 00:45:21,608
I go out there on my own--

692
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:23,876
and they sell
your tenured ass for parts.

693
00:45:24,484 --> 00:45:25,759
In so many words.

694
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:30,231
Anyway, um, we're looking
for 18 to 21 year olds.

695
00:45:30,443 --> 00:45:33,742
This is where we see the demographic
peak in violent behavior.

696
00:45:34,663 --> 00:45:36,274
You excuse us for a minute?

697
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,922
What happens when
you ain't around to translate?

698
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,462
Don't play ignorant on me, Bunny.

699
00:45:46,524 --> 00:45:48,798
You can back-and-forth
with any of these guys.

700
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:50,076
I've seen you work.

701
00:45:50,142 --> 00:45:53,108
Besides, it's clear you ain't
cut out for the private sector.

702
00:45:54,234 --> 00:45:55,443
18 to 21?

703
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,660
By that age,
they're deep in the game.

704
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,858
He's fucked on that.

705
00:45:58,894 --> 00:46:00,044
So show him.

706
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:06,125
50,000, 80-20 health plan,
and a take-home vehicle.

707
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:09,104
I'd be amazed if they
give you 30, an H.M.O.,

708
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,726
and a bus pass.

709
00:46:34,963 --> 00:46:38,600
YVONNE WINS BY 30 MIN OR HALF HOUR

710
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:53,350
Peace. See you later.

711
00:46:53,403 --> 00:46:55,580
I go in there now,
you know what that makes me?

712
00:46:56,412 --> 00:46:59,514
Some fucking asshole politician
who's running for office.

713
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:03,977
Watkins. 40th district.

714
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:08,399
- You call the reporters?
- All 3 channels and "the sun."

715
00:47:30,971 --> 00:47:32,139
My condolences.

716
00:47:32,961 --> 00:47:34,571
- I'm Thomas--
- I know who you are.

717
00:47:34,777 --> 00:47:36,034
Thanks for your respects.

718
00:47:55,711 --> 00:47:57,127
I'm so sorry for your loss.

719
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:59,453
We shouldn't be here today
just because...

720
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,949
your son
came forward as a witness...

721
00:48:03,001 --> 00:48:04,133
what do you mean?

722
00:48:04,722 --> 00:48:05,908
I know it's...

723
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:10,918
I'm just sorry for your loss.
That's all.

724
00:48:44,103 --> 00:48:45,696
A parent's worst nightmare.

725
00:48:46,955 --> 00:48:48,991
I don't know how anybody
can go on after this.

726
00:48:49,114 --> 00:48:50,318
Yeah, me neither.

727
00:48:51,807 --> 00:48:52,812
Ms. Daniels.

728
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:53,998
Councilman.

729
00:48:54,918 --> 00:48:56,881
How's things going over
in the 11th district?

730
00:48:56,987 --> 00:48:59,779
Harder than I'd hoped for.
Even on the mayor's ticket.

731
00:48:59,885 --> 00:49:02,168
Yeah.
Eunetta's pretty well entrenched.

732
00:49:02,502 --> 00:49:03,830
Good luck with it, though.

733
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:06,507
The council sure could use you.

734
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:15,362
Councilman Carcetti,
can you give us a minute?

735
00:49:15,397 --> 00:49:17,698
- Councilman, over here.
- Do you mind doing a standup?

736
00:49:17,751 --> 00:49:19,661
Look, guys,
I'm sorry, you know.

737
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:21,139
Now's not the time.

738
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:23,974
I don't really have anything to say.
I'm sorry.

739
00:49:24,523 --> 00:49:26,824
- What, is he kidding?
- What did we come out here for?

740
00:49:26,859 --> 00:49:29,302
You don't want the press coverage?
Are you out of your mind?

741
00:49:29,338 --> 00:49:31,416
We'll get time on the 11:00
from the visual alone.

742
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,990
but I start making speeches
right here? Now?

743
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:35,526
How's that really gonna look?

744
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:38,323
Boss, as political theater,
this is pretty fucking lame.

745
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:41,200
Yeah, well, you know,
that depends on the audience.

746
00:49:46,565 --> 00:49:47,804
This is Shawn Williams.

747
00:49:49,202 --> 00:49:51,390
<i>Lieutenant,</i>
<i>please call shift commander.</i>

748
00:49:53,105 --> 00:49:54,610
Boss, you want me to stay?

749
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:57,245
No. We're good.

750
00:50:04,348 --> 00:50:06,373
So, Shawn...

751
00:50:06,444 --> 00:50:08,891
you police. He ain't.

752
00:50:11,726 --> 00:50:12,870
Shawn, how old are you?

753
00:50:12,923 --> 00:50:16,250
18. How old are you,
you shinehead motherfucker?

754
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:20,738
You have a sister, Shawn?

755
00:50:20,769 --> 00:50:22,492
What the fuck you want with my sister?

756
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:26,416
And what the fuck's this chucky
cheese-lookin' motherfucker writing?

757
00:50:29,856 --> 00:50:33,413
Let's say you hear
that your sister was assaulted.

758
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:35,026
Who fucked with my sister?

759
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:37,303
- She wasn't. I'm just saying.
- Sayin' what?

760
00:50:37,374 --> 00:50:39,422
Why you fuckin'
with my head, motherfucker?

761
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,127
And this bitch is writing again.

762
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,272
It's a habit.

763
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:44,304
Now, what would you do
if you heard your sister

764
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:45,694
got beat up by some guy?

765
00:50:47,506 --> 00:50:48,632
Which sister?

766
00:50:48,986 --> 00:50:51,714
I don't know. 'Cause it's Cherise,
she probably had it coming.

767
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:53,361
All right, another sister then.

768
00:50:54,204 --> 00:50:56,805
Danielle?
I'd fuck that guy up.

769
00:50:57,564 --> 00:50:58,838
I'd fuck his ass shut.

770
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:00,232
With you in jail.

771
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,365
I'd get my boy to do it.

772
00:51:01,419 --> 00:51:02,781
What if you didn't have no boy?

773
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:04,790
Then I'd get the nigger
myself when I get out.

774
00:51:04,843 --> 00:51:07,871
- What if you had a life sentence?
- Then I'll fuckin' escape.

775
00:51:07,947 --> 00:51:09,667
And put that fuckin' pen down

776
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,274
'fore I shove it up
your motherfuckin' ass.

777
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:17,368
What if you couldn't escape, Shawn?

778
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,758
Fuck you.

779
00:51:20,573 --> 00:51:21,582
Fuck you.

780
00:51:23,014 --> 00:51:24,590
Would you go to the police?

781
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:28,890
Just a question.

782
00:51:35,555 --> 00:51:38,227
Son, thanks for being you.

783
00:51:41,803 --> 00:51:42,812
Thanks.

784
00:51:44,928 --> 00:51:46,998
Look, I'm ready
to acknowledge that...

785
00:51:47,502 --> 00:51:49,464
18 to 21 might be too seasoned.

786
00:51:58,462 --> 00:52:00,108
How you fixed for juveniles?

787
00:52:00,735 --> 00:52:02,416
Right now? Fresh out.

788
00:52:02,632 --> 00:52:04,455
The van to baby booking just left.

789
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:07,325
But are you looking
for kids in the system?

790
00:52:07,422 --> 00:52:08,563
Or just kids?

791
00:52:08,602 --> 00:52:10,979
'Cause if it is, you got Douglass
right around the corner,

792
00:52:11,024 --> 00:52:12,895
- and school's in this week.
- High school?

793
00:52:13,032 --> 00:52:14,578
That's what?
15 to 18, right?

794
00:52:14,808 --> 00:52:18,099
Yeah, but I would...
I'd go younger even.

795
00:52:27,004 --> 00:52:28,650
Kima. 'Sup, girl?

796
00:52:28,898 --> 00:52:30,225
Are you sure?

797
00:52:32,427 --> 00:52:34,869
C'mon. I'm the one who
took you out of the eastern,

798
00:52:34,922 --> 00:52:36,126
sent you to the show.

799
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,027
You can't come back here;
you too good for a district.

800
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,411
I need a home, Major.

801
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:43,601
If you need to make a move,
move up or at leas lateral.

802
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,668
But a district
is you going backwards.

803
00:52:47,346 --> 00:52:49,458
And you don't need to be
under my wing, either.

804
00:52:49,653 --> 00:52:52,167
You're gonna be valued
no matter where you land.

805
00:52:53,902 --> 00:52:55,229
Let me talk to people.

806
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:59,011
I especially liked the timing
for when you flew your paper.

807
00:52:59,942 --> 00:53:00,951
Shrewd.

808
00:53:01,408 --> 00:53:03,572
I couldn't see
anybody shutting us down,

809
00:53:04,475 --> 00:53:05,696
not with the elections.

810
00:53:05,854 --> 00:53:07,801
What asshole would risk the headline?

811
00:53:09,457 --> 00:53:11,379
But to gut us from the inside out...

812
00:53:11,786 --> 00:53:14,087
Charlie Marimow.
My trojan horse.

813
00:53:18,765 --> 00:53:21,781
And now, let me guess,
to save your wire,

814
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:23,604
you're prepared to go to judge Davis.

815
00:53:24,754 --> 00:53:26,294
If my memory serves,

816
00:53:26,507 --> 00:53:29,454
this isn't the first time a deputy ops
felt the need to bury you.

817
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:31,261
You have a gift for martyrdom.

818
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:37,604
I wonder, though, are your disciples
as keen for the cross?

819
00:53:42,566 --> 00:53:43,947
In your final court report,

820
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,905
it would be prudent to tell the judge

821
00:53:46,607 --> 00:53:48,571
the investigation hit a dead end.

822
00:54:02,082 --> 00:54:06,844
I doubt you'll believe it,
but... I respect the effort.

823
00:54:08,591 --> 00:54:10,167
You're a hell of an investigator.

824
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:18,230
It would be too much to expect you
to serve under Lieutenant Marimow?

825
00:54:19,611 --> 00:54:20,956
The man's a virus.

826
00:54:24,547 --> 00:54:27,220
Homicide, then.
That's you, right?

827
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:31,652
Yeah.

828
00:54:33,884 --> 00:54:35,584
I know it's hard
right now, Detective.

829
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:39,124
but...
try to think on this as a favor.

830
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:08,059
This seems right.

831
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,148
Yeah.

832
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,176
So I understand my old unit's
gone to Lieutenant Marimow.

833
00:55:14,233 --> 00:55:15,366
Yes, it has.

834
00:55:16,161 --> 00:55:17,542
So that unit is...

835
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:19,067
yes, it is.

836
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:20,460
That's a shame.

837
00:55:21,283 --> 00:55:23,946
I need to ask if you could
take care of my girl Greggs.

838
00:55:24,282 --> 00:55:26,277
She's a good cop
looking for a home,

839
00:55:26,343 --> 00:55:28,477
and I think she'd be
a natural homicide.

840
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,545
Well, there was an opening.

841
00:55:34,928 --> 00:55:36,582
Just filled that last night.

842
00:55:36,813 --> 00:55:38,971
Another fugitive
from major crimes,

843
00:55:39,777 --> 00:55:40,804
but...

844
00:55:41,635 --> 00:55:42,804
for you, Major?

845
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:46,152
Let me see who I don't love no more.

846
00:55:49,382 --> 00:55:54,083
OK, so, if a rocket travels say,
1,000 miles an hour,

847
00:55:54,455 --> 00:55:56,198
how far does it go in an hour?

848
00:55:58,407 --> 00:55:59,416
Darnell.

849
00:56:06,674 --> 00:56:07,761
Chiquan?

850
00:56:07,836 --> 00:56:10,934
As far as it wants. I mean,
it's a rocket ship, right?

851
00:56:15,693 --> 00:56:16,808
Randy?

852
00:56:16,952 --> 00:56:18,244
Is this a trick question?

853
00:56:18,457 --> 00:56:19,466
Nope.

854
00:56:21,452 --> 00:56:22,567
1,000 miles?

855
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:24,630
On the money.

856
00:56:25,409 --> 00:56:27,681
Mr. Prezbo,
I was gonna say that.

857
00:56:32,534 --> 00:56:34,498
Go 'head, bitch.
Laugh at me now.

858
00:56:39,081 --> 00:56:40,535
What?
You want some?

859
00:56:44,486 --> 00:56:46,274
You on the fucking floor, bitch.

860
00:56:46,509 --> 00:56:47,783
Laugh at me now.

861
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,643
I don't hear shit.

862
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:56,516
Crystal, have the office call 911,
and get the nurse.

863
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,080
Everybody in your seats.

864
00:57:01,233 --> 00:57:03,127
Just lay still.
Just lay still.

865
00:57:07,634 --> 00:57:09,545
Just keep putting pressure on it.

866
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,069
You're going fine.
Chiquan, you're doing fine.

867
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,387
Just hold on
for a few more minutes.

868
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:22,885
It's gonna be OK.
It's gonna be OK.

869
00:57:37,728 --> 00:57:41,211
