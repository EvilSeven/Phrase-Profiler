1
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,599
I thought he was supposed to have
a breakfast date, right?

2
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,300
I mean,
they told me that last night.

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,200
Breakfast?
Is that on the schedge?

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,999
It isn't,
but the lieutenant told me

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,299
that he'd be doing
breakfast

6
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,700
with someone down at the harbor.

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,000
I mean,
if he ain't,

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,600
I could go get this gassed up
at the fallsway.

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,700
I hate this detail, man.

10
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:49,801
It's off duty.
Lotsa perks.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,401
All this stand around
and wait,

12
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:55,801
you know?

13
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:57,407
Hoskins says I do the 1 year,

14
00:00:57,906 --> 00:00:59,701
and I'll make sergeant
on the next list.

15
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:01,090
Yeah.
They told me, career wise,

16
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:03,000
you can't do better
than drive the mayor.

17
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:05,302
Shit, if you could
make rank the right way,

18
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:07,403
I'll still be working Western drugs.

19
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:19,700
All right,
fuck this,

20
00:01:19,806 --> 00:01:21,390
I'm gonna go look
for the lieutenant.

21
00:01:21,406 --> 00:01:22,400
Anyone comes looking,

22
00:01:22,505 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm back up on the second floor.

23
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,001
Sir?

24
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:35,602
I understood that the mayor
might be going to, uh,

25
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:36,902
breakfast at the harbor?

26
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:38,103
With Kweisi.

27
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:40,802
But, um,
that's up in the air, I thought.

28
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:43,601
Would you happen to know
where Lieutenant Hoskins is?

29
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:09,102
Sir?

30
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:18,100
Lieutenant?

31
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:24,027
Season 4 - Episode 2
"Soft Eyes"

32
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,600
You don't look happy, detective.

33
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:37,101
We're about to raise some hell.

34
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:41,001
Maybe... too much hell.

35
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:44,903
A state senator,
2 councilmen,

36
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:46,902
the city
development agency,

37
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,403
All those developers...

38
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:49,903
princes of the city.

39
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:52,800
Lester, tell me the thought
hasn't crossed your mind

40
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:55,090
that some kinda shit
could blow back on us, man.

41
00:04:55,107 --> 00:04:57,702
Do you know what
Theodore Roosevelt said about

42
00:04:57,907 --> 00:04:59,201
hunting grizzly bears?

43
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:00,693
The thrill is

44
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,503
in overcoming your own fear.

45
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:04,501
What was the thrill for the bear?

46
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,992
I should've run every one
of these subpoenas by my front office.

47
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,401
That's not procedure.

48
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:14,003
Fuck procedure, Lester.

49
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:18,803
My boss is running 2 points behind
in the polls with the mayor's support.

50
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:21,067
How do you think he's gonna do
if he pisses off Royce

51
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:22,852
and starts dropping off
incumbent tickets?

52
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:24,100
Why do you care?

53
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,302
If Demper thinks
I fucked him and he wins,

54
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:31,501
I will be at central booking
covering bail reviews.

55
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:34,203
If he loses to bond,
a new front office comes in

56
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:36,692
and maybe they bounce
the white girl back to a trial team

57
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:38,891
and give the narcotics division
to one of their own.

58
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,403
It's Baltimore, Lester.

59
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,703
We're missing
a couple of subpoenas.

60
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:44,403
We are?

61
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:49,100
Clay Davis
and Andy Krawczyk.

62
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:51,503
I'm holding those 'til October.

63
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,603
Oh, the hell you are.

64
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:56,900
Lester, we drop subpoenas
on either of those guys

65
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,703
3 weeks before the primary,

66
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:00,101
and all hell breaks loose.

67
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:01,391
That's what I'm sayin'!

68
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:04,701
Clay Davis is Royce's
deputy campaign chairman,

69
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:07,703
and the number 2 man at
the city legislative caucus.

70
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:09,991
And Krawczyk is his
number 1 fundraiser!

71
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:12,300
You're giving me resumes
and job titles.

72
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,901
I'm just following the money.

73
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,902
And we will follow it...
after the polls close.

74
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,503
We can drop a second batch
of subpoenas.

75
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:22,102
There is no reason
to do this now and risk...

76
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:23,202
A year ago,

77
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:25,002
if we had gone after these records,

78
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:26,590
City Hall would've stomped on

79
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:28,601
this unit
and the subpoenas.

80
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,503
And a month from now,
after Royce is reelected,

81
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:34,502
they'll do us the same way.

82
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:36,701
But right now,

83
00:06:37,307 --> 00:06:39,002
with the primary coming,

84
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:41,203
they gotta worry about
how they look,

85
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:42,600
how they behave.

86
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:46,903
Right now,
they gotta worry about scandal.

87
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,103
You told me you wanted
to do this a year ago,

88
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:54,800
but fresh cases got in the way.

89
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:00,302
You told me that.

90
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,200
Very clever, Lester.

91
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:10,302
You got it all figured, huh?

92
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:12,102
Me?

93
00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:15,201
I'm just the police.

94
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:21,700
I saw the teachers' union
finally endorsed Royce.

95
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,103
You knew they were gonna.

96
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,303
What time's your first appearance?

97
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,701
Today?

98
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:35,203
I meet up with you guys
at the SoWeBo forum.

99
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:37,293
And tonight, it's me and the kids

100
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:39,701
next to Tommy
at the Roland Park fundraiser.

101
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:48,802
Better speed things along.

102
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:51,702
A kick in the ass sometimes helps.

103
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:55,003
B-5?

104
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:57,103
No, daddy, d-5.

105
00:07:58,808 --> 00:08:00,303
You sure you didn't say b-5?

106
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,702
D-5.

107
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,202
What did I hit?

108
00:08:03,507 --> 00:08:04,601
Submarine.

109
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:10,700
E-6.

110
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:12,303
Miss.

111
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:17,401
Just gimme 10 minutes.

112
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:18,603
You seen your schedule today?

113
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,800
You ain't got 10 minutes.

114
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:23,702
Norman, I got this pretty girl's
aircraft carrier boxed in.

115
00:08:24,106 --> 00:08:25,103
D-4.

116
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:28,100
Hit.

117
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,503
Tommy,
for Christ's sakes.

118
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:31,601
Is there any way that I can win?

119
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,303
With the numbers what they are,
is there any way at all?

120
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:36,790
Right, so if it's just a matter
of playing out the string,

121
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:38,091
then that's what
I'm gonna do.

122
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,690
That game's pretty much
over, Norman.

123
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:42,202
But this game,
this game right here,

124
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:44,701
this one
could still go either way.

125
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:48,000
H-11,
sweetheart.

126
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,600
Miss.
D-3.

127
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:42,503
So I guess
y'all getting what y'all need?

128
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:44,203
Brianna keepin' y'all close?

129
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:45,400
She come up with it.

130
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:47,803
Money comin' through
every month like she say.

131
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,403
A'ight.
'Cause I'm standin' tall up in here.

132
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:52,202
They don't need
to worry about me

133
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:53,903
an' I ain't need
to worry about them.

134
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:55,100
You a soldier, Bey.

135
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:56,400
You know it.

136
00:09:58,605 --> 00:10:00,300
Everything all right
with my fishes?

137
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:02,902
You'd tell me if it wasn't, right?

138
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:04,202
The fish be fine.

139
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:05,603
I mean, they fish, right?

140
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,691
How I know how they
feelin' about shit?

141
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:08,701
De'londa...

142
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,900
they fine, Bey.
Ask Namond.

143
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,202
Cleaned the tank an' all,
like you say.

144
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:14,692
Cleaned the filter, too.

145
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,901
A'ight, a'ight.

146
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,301
Check you out, though.

147
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:19,407
Getting some fuzz up there, huh?

148
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:21,501
Yeah, whatever.

149
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,690
I know when I was a little kid, boy,

150
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,402
I couldn't wait
till I started shaving.

151
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:27,203
One of the old heads
on the corner say,

152
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:29,503
"Hey, little man,
you wanna grow a stache?

153
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:31,402
"Next time you take a piss,

154
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:32,601
"take some of that piss,

155
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:33,903
"get it on your fingertips,

156
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:35,103
do like this, here..."

157
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:37,901
- You do it?
- You damn right I did it.

158
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:39,901
Shit.

159
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,102
What's going on with you,
though, son?

160
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,200
Ain't nothing.

161
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:44,403
School about to start.

162
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,301
So what about Bodie and his boys?

163
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:48,702
They treatin' you right?

164
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:50,500
Yeah, he cool.

165
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:53,001
Boy, don't lie to your father.

166
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:56,300
He don't even show up
for work half the damn time.

167
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,401
Bodie told me.

168
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:59,103
I missed a few days.
That's all, dad.

169
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:02,001
And what money you do make,
you waste on nonsense.

170
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:04,093
And if you think
I'm gonna give you a dime

171
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:07,100
for your school clothes,
you better think again.

172
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:08,992
What Bodie got you doin'?

173
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:10,403
I'm a runner, most days.

174
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:12,190
Everybody got to start somewhere.

175
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:13,903
You better listen to your father.

176
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,800
He ain't tell you 'bout
that hair, though, huh?

177
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:19,003
Yeah, he said I gotta get it cut.

178
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:20,401
I like it this way.

179
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:22,102
Even the white police
lookin' out from

180
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:23,893
3 blocks away gonna
be able to spot you

181
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:25,302
from every other nigga out there.

182
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:27,590
They gonna hop out and say,
"Look at the boy over there

183
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:29,501
with the pretty ass
pony-tail. Get him."

184
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:31,703
You think I'm bullshitting.

185
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:34,800
Either you real out there,
or you ain't, Nay.

186
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:36,803
You see what I'm sayin'?

187
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:45,102
Let me get some!

188
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,503
Over here!

189
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:51,303
Thank you, Mr. Marlo!

190
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:52,500
Thank you!

191
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:00,300
That's my money, yo!

192
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,102
Your name gonna ring out, man.

193
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,300
Manuel,
tu empiezas enfrente,

194
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,502
yo hago la parte de atras.

195
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:19,300
A Cutty le gusta por atras, eh?

196
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah, no tanto
como a ti maricon.

197
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:26,892
Boy, you talk
that shit better'n me

198
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:29,201
and I been dealin' with
these Mexicans for years now.

199
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:32,303
Yeah, I don't think they would call
what I'm speakin' Spanish, man.

200
00:12:32,405 --> 00:12:34,403
Just a dirty word
or 2 here or there.

201
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:36,603
Yeah, well.
Once you can talk to these cats,

202
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:38,600
the only thing you need
then is a truck, man.

203
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:40,393
Could be runnin' your own crew,

204
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:41,702
pickin' up fresh clients.

205
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:43,802
I mean,
if we put in together

206
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:45,491
we could be coverin'
twice the ground,

207
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:46,702
makin' twice as much.

208
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:49,901
Nah, man,
I got other obligations.

209
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:51,801
Oh, right.

210
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:54,302
You set to be
the new Angelo Dundee.

211
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,701
I near forgot.

212
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:57,900
Chinga te bendajo.

213
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:00,403
Chinga a la tuya
hijo de puta.

214
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:05,792
I thought you already went up

215
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:07,691
to Mondawmin to get
your school shit, man.

216
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:08,900
Yeah, but not all of it.

217
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,592
And my boy,
he need to pay for his own shit

218
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:12,801
and his little brother, too.

219
00:13:12,907 --> 00:13:15,301
The fuck this look like,
a social services office?

220
00:13:15,605 --> 00:13:17,390
You want a check,
go the fuck up Rosemont.

221
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:19,103
Come on, man,
I'll work for it.

222
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:23,101
Nay, I took you on
outta respect for your father,

223
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:24,090
a'ight,
but I can't

224
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:26,203
go hirin' the whole damn neighborhood.

225
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,500
You can have my job until
you get enough for you an' bug.

226
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:30,801
Thanks, man.

227
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:33,003
Yeah, work for y'all,
work for me, yo.

228
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:34,601
Po-po.
Step the fuck off.

229
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:46,501
Looking for your man Lex.

230
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:48,702
I see his broom,
but I don't see him.

231
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:50,700
Where's your number 2 been at?

232
00:13:51,108 --> 00:13:52,092
I ain't seen him.

233
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:53,201
Since when?

234
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,602
I thought we were on better terms.

235
00:13:55,905 --> 00:13:58,700
Or do you want me rolling past
lookin' for Lex every 15 minutes?

236
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:00,902
He come past,
I'll call you.

237
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,402
I will!

238
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:19,502
If he come past.

239
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:23,003
Oh, no,
I don't know.

240
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:25,203
They're spinning their wheels.

241
00:14:25,508 --> 00:14:26,801
You know,
poor Tony Gray,

242
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:29,401
pulling 20% of the black vote.

243
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,401
It's embarrassing.

244
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:35,093
Well, who knows what the fuck
Carcetti's trying to prove?

245
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:36,793
But I tell you,
at the end of this thing,

246
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:39,200
he's gonna regret getting
on the wrong side of me.

247
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:41,903
A'ight, now.

248
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:44,401
I got what you need, boy,

249
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:46,803
clean tees,
any sizes, huh?

250
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:48,501
Lookin' for socks,
briefs,

251
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:51,401
you lookin' for dice,
zippos, cards...

252
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:53,700
Come on over
to the rollin' emporium.

253
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:56,702
You ain't gotta walk to rite-aid.
Shit, rite-aid comin' to y'all.

254
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:58,103
What can I get you, baby?

255
00:14:58,306 --> 00:14:59,802
Fresh dice
an' a pack of Trojans.

256
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:00,900
All righty.

257
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:02,500
You got philly blunts, too?

258
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:03,803
Bubbles got it all, dawg.

259
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,191
I'm the 1-stop shop.

260
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,400
How much is that?

261
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:07,703
6 an' a bit.

262
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,500
Thank you.
Thank you kindly.

263
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:12,000
Yes, sir, I see
what you're lookin' at.

264
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:14,501
2 a deck. Name brand.
You can't beat that price.

265
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:16,103
Yeah, let me get 2 decks, man,

266
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:18,502
and a white tee, double-X.

267
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:20,793
And give me the rest
of them paint cans, too, man.

268
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:22,303
All right, all right, there you go.

269
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,500
That's it?

270
00:15:23,707 --> 00:15:24,903
Yeah, what's that?

271
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,502
How much the man owe, Sherrod?

272
00:15:35,706 --> 00:15:36,700
13.

273
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:38,301
He asked for all the cans.

274
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,502
3 cans is 12,
plus the other stuff.

275
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:44,991
It's 19. 19, sir. Come on,
you still gettin' off with a deal,

276
00:15:45,008 --> 00:15:46,601
now, you didn't have
to move your feet.

277
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,791
We came to you, right?

278
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:48,801
My bad.

279
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:50,601
19, like he said.

280
00:15:52,006 --> 00:15:54,601
Thank you very much.
He's an intern, I'm working with him.

281
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:58,902
But, ma'am,
what I'm asking is

282
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:02,100
when was the last time
you saw Lex?

283
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:04,401
Oh, excuse me, Curtis?

284
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:09,703
2 days ago?

285
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:10,991
I don't know where he at.

286
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,100
3 days?

287
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,702
You mind if I look around?

288
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,602
I'd rather you leave my house be.

289
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:20,103
Well, Ms. Anderson...

290
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,100
your son is in trouble,

291
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:27,603
and I can tell you're upset.

292
00:16:28,406 --> 00:16:30,201
But the best thing
that you can do for him,

293
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:32,001
the best thing that
he can do for himself,

294
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:33,201
is talk to me.

295
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,203
I'm gonna tell you the truth:

296
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,602
we know he's selling drugs.

297
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:42,400
- And I'm gonna tell you...
- I don't know nothin' about that.

298
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:46,001
But I'm telling you that
I don't care he's selling drugs.

299
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,603
I'm not even gonna bother with that.

300
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:55,403
I'm here because of a homicide,

301
00:16:56,508 --> 00:16:58,003
and the way it looks right now

302
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,301
your boy is running from the police
behind that killing.

303
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:03,503
I don't know where he at...

304
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,400
ma'a...

305
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:23,503
Councilman,
my people got only

306
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:26,102
cost-of-living bumps for 4 years.

307
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:29,403
Morale is at rock bottom.

308
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,593
All things being equal,
you'd be our guy.

309
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:33,802
We like what we hear.

310
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:36,403
The polls say it's going to be Royce.

311
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:38,793
We endorse you now,
we're out in the cold.

312
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:39,801
Bobby...

313
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:43,402
this might be the chance to get in on
the ground floor of something better.

314
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:45,691
That may be true, Major.
But for now,

315
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,901
we're gonna play
the cards that we were dealt.

316
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:50,391
Councilman, if you were me,
I'm sure...

317
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:52,101
I'd cover my ass
and endorse Royce,

318
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:54,501
along with the teachers
and the firefighters.

319
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:57,202
But I'd also tell my membership
not to get carried away,

320
00:17:57,308 --> 00:18:00,591
I mean, it's one thing for
the police union to call out for Royce,

321
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:02,890
it's another thing entirely
for off duty cops

322
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:05,201
to be manning
the mayor's phone banks

323
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:06,901
and polling stations.

324
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,691
I don't think
any of my officers

325
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:10,901
will be too aggressive
for anybody.

326
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,702
That much I can give you.

327
00:18:17,106 --> 00:18:18,602
Best you could do, Tommy.

328
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,203
Royce has got all those
fucks runnin' scared.

329
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:24,100
Yeah...

330
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:26,703
best I could do.

331
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:28,692
Call it a night, Tommy.

332
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:30,602
You got a debate
to prepare for tomorrow.

333
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:33,001
Yeah.
The debate.

334
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:35,403
Nothing matters more at this point.

335
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,302
Let the truth
set you free, Norman.

336
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,803
Nothing matters at all.

337
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:46,003
Thanks.

338
00:18:57,507 --> 00:19:00,101
Come on, boy,
come on now.

339
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,402
Man, you better not be getting tired,

340
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:04,302
'cause you gonna get put to the test

341
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:05,602
on Saturday night.

342
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:06,702
I'm ready.

343
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:09,803
- Hey, Miss Johnson.
- Hey, Justin. Hello, Dennis.

344
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:11,201
You're Spider's mother, right?

345
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:13,000
Right, Sharon.
Sharon Johnson.

346
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:14,600
Your boy left here a while ago.

347
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,900
I ain't looking for him.
He at his grandmother's.

348
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:19,002
I wanted to ask you something.

349
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:23,402
You know,
my son is crazy about you.

350
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:26,101
All he talks about
is boxing, bein' at the gym,

351
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,890
and what his coach
been teachin' him.

352
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:29,191
Well, Spider's a good kid.

353
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:30,702
He really studies the sport.

354
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:33,902
Dennis, I am so grateful
for your interest in Spider,

355
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:35,393
I want to cook you dinner.

356
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:36,491
How 'bout tonight?

357
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:39,702
Well, ah,
that is really nice, Sharon.

358
00:19:40,108 --> 00:19:43,291
But the thing is, I got 4 of my boys
fighting this weekend,

359
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:46,203
and I got to train 'em really hard
these next few evenings.

360
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:47,900
You in here every night
of the week.

361
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:49,403
What you do for fun?

362
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:52,300
Look here,
you got to eat, right?

363
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,501
And you can look at me and know

364
00:19:55,006 --> 00:19:56,592
I throw down in the kitchen...

365
00:19:56,605 --> 00:19:58,202
among other places.

366
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,003
Yeah, I tell you what.

367
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:03,400
If you fix me up a plate
and bring it over here,

368
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:04,790
I would love that.

369
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:06,100
That I can do.

370
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:10,903
He said what?

371
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:14,602
"Me, I'm just the police."

372
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:18,403
Like butter
wouldn't melt in his mouth.

373
00:20:19,705 --> 00:20:21,302
And the thing
that I resent most

374
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:23,061
is that he's not just
playing the system,

375
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:24,303
he's playing me.

376
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,701
Like I'm part of the problem.

377
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:31,302
You were gonna hold back the paper
for Davis and Krawczyk, right?

378
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:34,303
Only until the primary was over.

379
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:36,500
And now you feel guilty about it.

380
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:42,501
Did he do that thing where he, uh,

381
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,303
stares at you over the top
of his reading glasses?

382
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:48,100
You know,
that look that says,

383
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:51,101
"I'm the father you never had,

384
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:54,502
and I don't want to be
disappointed in you ever again."

385
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:58,303
It's not funny, Cedric!

386
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:02,002
Those subpoenas went out today!

387
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:05,201
The front office is gonna go batshit!

388
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,602
But you did it anyway.

389
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:12,702
I'm sorry, but shit,
I'm just glad to see

390
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:15,002
Lester doing it to somebody
other than me.

391
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:32,600
Hey, you holdin' us back, Sherrod.

392
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,400
I made a mistake, man,
why you trippin'?

393
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:39,893
If I can cut you loose
to handle the money,

394
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:42,800
we can cover twice the ground,
selling twice the merchandise.

395
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:45,903
More... more... what you call it,
market share.

396
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:49,101
Instead I gotta keep your ass close.

397
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:51,800
You shoulda been promoted
to your own cart by now.

398
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:54,191
You keep on hittin' your dome
on the glass ceiling.

399
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,202
Glass what?

400
00:21:55,508 --> 00:21:57,390
I'm sayin' you gotta
step up the math skills

401
00:21:57,407 --> 00:21:59,402
if you wanna advance in
this here enterprise.

402
00:21:59,442 --> 00:22:02,290
You remember last spring when
you tried to take me up to Harlem Park?

403
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:04,003
They couldn't even find
my records, Bubs.

404
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:05,593
They didn't want shit to do with me.

405
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:07,102
They put you in a classroom, right?

406
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:08,693
The teacher didn't look at me once.

407
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:09,901
So you rolled out.

408
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:12,901
An' who got hurt behind that, huh?
The teacher or you?

409
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:16,801
What's 4 times 5
plus 6 times 7?

410
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,500
See? See?

411
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:31,903
Fuck that shit, son.
I can't wait until school starts.

412
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:34,302
- You joking, right?
- Nah, seriously, son.

413
00:22:34,406 --> 00:22:35,802
I can't wait to see all them girls,

414
00:22:35,908 --> 00:22:38,502
you know, see which ones
got phat over the summer, you know?

415
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,302
- Guess who I saw last week?
- Who?

416
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:41,593
Kwaneese Davis.

417
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:43,701
Oh, shit, you mean
cute ass Kwaneese?

418
00:22:45,306 --> 00:22:47,703
- She phat?
- Got titties, too.

419
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,702
I'm definitely tappin'
that pussy, now, y'all watch.

420
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:52,490
I'm be all up
in Kwaneese this year

421
00:22:52,508 --> 00:22:53,700
like this, bangin' that...

422
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,701
Just like you
tried to do last year, right?

423
00:22:56,107 --> 00:22:58,202
Fuck you, nigga,
I only halfway tried.

424
00:22:58,808 --> 00:23:00,901
So, Michael,
who you gettin' with this year?

425
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:02,976
Stankin' ass, what's her name?
What's her name?

426
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:05,002
Oh, Tina.
Tina... Tina Jenkins.

427
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:06,890
Don't talk bad
about Tina, man.

428
00:23:06,906 --> 00:23:08,003
I'm not sayin' that it bad.

429
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:10,090
I'm sayin' she be
sucking dudes' dicks

430
00:23:10,107 --> 00:23:12,300
in the boys' bathroom and shit,
that's all.

431
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:16,103
She suck dick even
better than you do, Namond.

432
00:23:18,908 --> 00:23:20,503
What up?
What up, see?

433
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:21,903
Good jabbin', man.

434
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:25,601
Chill, chill, chill!

435
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:28,303
Don't rip this shit.
I just bought this throwback.

436
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:30,466
Yo, Michael, son,
if I ain't had this shit on,

437
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:32,903
I'd of fucked you up.
Word up.

438
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:35,390
You little niggas
ain't up to no good, is you?

439
00:23:35,406 --> 00:23:36,903
Yo, what up, Monk?

440
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:40,101
Look here, first day
of school coming up, right?

441
00:23:40,505 --> 00:23:41,503
Yeah, next week.

442
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:43,801
So, y'all need, like,
school clothes and shit?

443
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:45,903
Here...

444
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:48,301
Yo, what's this for?

445
00:23:48,606 --> 00:23:50,501
What, you ain't hear me?
For new clothes.

446
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:52,103
Whatever else you need to get.

447
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:54,201
Thanks, man!

448
00:23:54,305 --> 00:23:55,503
Damn, 200?

449
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:57,103
Yo, thanks, Monk.

450
00:23:57,207 --> 00:23:59,003
Oh, you need to thank my man Marlo.

451
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,990
He ain't wanna see
you little motherfuckers

452
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:02,401
going raggedy on the first day.

453
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:04,802
That Marlo?

454
00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:06,402
Naw, man,
no thanks.

455
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:08,102
You ain't gotta do nothing for it.

456
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:09,502
No, thank you, man.

457
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:14,103
Hey, yo, mister Monk?

458
00:24:14,606 --> 00:24:16,303
I'll take his if he don't want it.

459
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:19,093
- I mean, I'll hold his for you...
- Yo, don't press, man.

460
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:20,103
Don't press.

461
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:25,300
Fuck is wrong with you, boy?

462
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:28,203
You too good for my money?

463
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:31,000
Or is you such a bitch-ass punk

464
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:33,400
you worried about
where my money come from?

465
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:48,903
Ain't no thing, shorty.

466
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:50,601
We cool.

467
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:05,103
You can't tell nobody.

468
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,700
Swear to me you won't
spread this around.

469
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:09,600
And he saw you?

470
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:11,301
Yeah, he saw me.

471
00:25:12,207 --> 00:25:15,401
Carv, I'm fucked in the ass
with a pineapple on this.

472
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:19,901
What the hell'd you say to him?

473
00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:22,493
I said, "Mr. Mayor, that's a good,
strong dick you got there,

474
00:25:22,506 --> 00:25:25,100
and I see you know how to use it."
I didn't say shit!

475
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:27,271
And I didn't wait for him
to say anything, either.

476
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:29,100
Shit, I'm never gonna
make rank now.

477
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:32,002
I'll end up riding the boat
or some shit like McNulty.

478
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,400
This is way beyond
my pay-grade.

479
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:43,700
We need to get with someone
who knows politics.

480
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:45,303
Who do we know like that?

481
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:49,791
On crime, he knows you're coming,

482
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:51,100
so he's gonna set some traps

483
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:53,503
and lean on stats
that say crime is down.

484
00:25:53,605 --> 00:25:56,500
He'll also try to inoculate himself
by making it about you.

485
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:58,193
Like you're playing
the race card

486
00:25:58,207 --> 00:25:59,993
if you talk about
drugs or violent crime.

487
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:01,490
He's hoping you'll back down.

488
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:03,000
But you come on twice as hard:

489
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:05,600
"Clarence Royce
has not made this city safe."

490
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:11,302
Hey, Jen, what's up?

491
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:12,600
<i>You got a second?</i>

492
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:14,300
No, I got time, what is it?

493
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:16,801
Oh, no,
you're kidding me.

494
00:26:18,606 --> 00:26:20,301
No, no,
I got the number here, yeah.

495
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:22,402
No, I'll straighten it out
straight away.

496
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:23,603
Yeah.

497
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:25,003
Shit.

498
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:29,401
I forgot to mail the check
to the fuckin' archdiocese.

499
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,901
My kid's gonna get tossed
outta St. Albans

500
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,301
if I don't get my shit together.

501
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:35,301
Tommy. Focus.

502
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:40,202
He comes at me with race
and some bullshit crime stats.

503
00:26:40,508 --> 00:26:42,601
I ignore the race thing
and counter by noting

504
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:44,091
that homicides are up 15%

505
00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:46,501
even though other
violent crime stats are down 12%.

506
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:48,393
I point out this
does not make sense

507
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:50,101
unless Royce is cooking
the crime stats,

508
00:26:50,205 --> 00:26:52,801
making robberies, rapes,
and assaults disappear.

509
00:26:52,908 --> 00:26:55,700
I suggest the mayor is not telling
the truth about crime in the city.

510
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:58,202
I conclude by declaring that
it is for all of Baltimore...

511
00:26:58,305 --> 00:26:59,302
every neighborhood...

512
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:02,502
that I'm making public safety
the cornerstone of my campaign.

513
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:07,903
Tomorrow night,
I will kick his ass.

514
00:27:08,507 --> 00:27:09,592
But the next morning,

515
00:27:09,605 --> 00:27:12,001
I still wake up white
in a city that ain't.

516
00:27:17,908 --> 00:27:18,902
Sister Theresa?

517
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:20,201
Hey, how you doing?

518
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:22,800
Yeah, Tommy Carcetti.

519
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:26,002
Yo, Randy, man,
you crack me up, son.

520
00:27:26,108 --> 00:27:28,603
Running behind him talking about,
"I'll take his, mister Monk.

521
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:29,502
Give his to me."

522
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,300
Listen, man,
I could've used that extra.

523
00:27:31,497 --> 00:27:32,992
I already spent
all the clothes money

524
00:27:33,008 --> 00:27:35,201
Miss Anna gave me on stuff
to sell at school.

525
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:37,202
Yo, and plus Marlo
wanted us to have it.

526
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,702
He want to show us
who callin' the shots out here.

527
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:41,592
Yo, Michael,
why you ain't take it?

528
00:27:41,605 --> 00:27:43,303
- At ain't me, man.
- Say what?

529
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:45,792
That owin' niggas for shit, man.
That ain't me.

530
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:47,493
Shit, I'll take any
motherfuckin' money

531
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:50,002
- if he givin' it away now.
- Why?

532
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:52,203
Shit, your family got
more money than all of us.

533
00:27:52,508 --> 00:27:54,292
Yeah, but my mom said
she cuttin' me off,

534
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:56,202
she ain't buyin' me school
clothes and shit.

535
00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:58,402
You already took my job
with Bodie, so...

536
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,893
Gentlemen.

537
00:28:02,905 --> 00:28:04,802
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit!

538
00:28:07,508 --> 00:28:10,201
Donut, you crazy, man.

539
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:13,293
Yo, Donut. You think you could
steal us one of them camper trucks?

540
00:28:13,307 --> 00:28:14,700
Yo, you steal us a camper truck,

541
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:16,693
we can all go campin'
out in the woods an' all.

542
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,002
I be scared in the woods.

543
00:28:18,107 --> 00:28:20,602
I don't mean far like that.
I mean like Howard county.

544
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:21,890
Naw, naw, naw, man.

545
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:23,591
The Ku Klux Klan
live in Howard county.

546
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:24,603
I know that for a fact.

547
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:26,490
Nigga, my aunt live
in Howard county.

548
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:28,301
There ain't no Ku Klux Klan there.

549
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,192
Nigga, you simple, I swear.

550
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:33,100
Hey, yo, Donut, drive me away
from these ignorant bitches, man.

551
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:36,003
You can't tell these niggas nothin'.
Move, motherfucker.

552
00:28:41,908 --> 00:28:43,903
Can you see over the steering wheel?

553
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:46,001
You think he'll talk to me?

554
00:28:46,407 --> 00:28:47,691
Use my name if you have to.

555
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:49,600
I had one of his sectors for 8 months.

556
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,303
What's wrong with that picture?

557
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,803
Nigga, if there was
a black one in the parking lot,

558
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,302
I would've took one.

559
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:06,800
Yo... knockos, knockos!

560
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:11,993
760 to K-G-A.

561
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:13,793
I got a bailout at Calhoun and Mosher,

562
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:17,402
6 to 8 juveniles beating feet North
in the alleys around Calhoun.

563
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:21,800
I love this.
Just like old times.

564
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:29,602
I don't need to chase these fucking
knuckleheads. I know half of 'em.

565
00:29:30,806 --> 00:29:32,500
Shit, I know where they hang.

566
00:29:33,406 --> 00:29:35,101
Besides, you're a little overdressed.

567
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:38,101
Let's just call this in
and go see the man about your thing.

568
00:30:01,406 --> 00:30:03,600
Yo, yo, man,
I ain't do nothin'!

569
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,901
- I ain't do nothin'!
- Then why you runnin'?

570
00:30:06,164 --> 00:30:08,492
- 'Cause you chasin' me.
- Yeah, right. What's your name?

571
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:11,303
- For real, man, I ain't do nothin'.
- What's your goddamn name?

572
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:12,701
- Randy.
- Randy what?

573
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,802
- Wagstaff.
- I know you ain't lying.

574
00:30:14,906 --> 00:30:16,270
Wouldn't nobody make that shit up.

575
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:17,961
Put your hands against
this fucking wall.

576
00:30:18,006 --> 00:30:19,203
Come on...
What do you know

577
00:30:19,306 --> 00:30:21,000
about hoppers bailing
from a stolen car?

578
00:30:21,107 --> 00:30:22,102
Nothin'.

579
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:26,600
Little motherfucker.
You slingin'.

580
00:30:26,707 --> 00:30:28,490
- No, sir. I swear to God.
- Hell you ain't.

581
00:30:28,505 --> 00:30:30,656
How else you walking
around with 200 in your pocket?

582
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,991
My foster mother gave me that
to buy school clothes with.

583
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:35,602
- Your foster mother gave you 200 cash?
- Yeah.

584
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:40,400
Tell her to come down to the Western,
and I'll give it back to her.

585
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:43,600
Beat feet, motherfucker,
'fore I lock your little ass up.

586
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:50,000
Don't be fucking lookin' at me, move.

587
00:30:54,706 --> 00:30:57,801
This right here, is fire.

588
00:30:58,907 --> 00:31:01,702
That said,
I'm ready to serve 'em myself

589
00:31:01,806 --> 00:31:03,702
and keep your names off the returns.

590
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:05,303
I've got my 20.

591
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:07,802
You two got to live
in this department.

592
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:12,303
Fuck 'em where they live.

593
00:31:18,707 --> 00:31:19,900
Let's go.

594
00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:28,000
The price of steel being what it is,

595
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,600
that's gonna kill us if we can't
pass along the overage.

596
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:32,203
Mr. Krawczyk?

597
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,600
- Baltimore city police.
- What's this?

598
00:31:34,706 --> 00:31:36,102
A subpoena for records.

599
00:31:37,507 --> 00:31:39,201
You need these right now,
because, uh,

600
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:41,302
I'm kinda up to my ass
in stuff today.

601
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:42,902
Honor it in a timely fashion.

602
00:31:43,105 --> 00:31:44,803
I think that's the legal standard.

603
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:46,403
No problem, Detective...

604
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:47,803
Shakima Greggs.

605
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,500
You're with the city?

606
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:52,303
Which unit?

607
00:31:52,406 --> 00:31:53,601
Major Crimes.

608
00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:02,601
Senator.

609
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,803
What the hell is this?

610
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:10,603
Subpoena for records.

611
00:32:11,005 --> 00:32:12,101
Sphinx club?

612
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:16,601
- Man of the year.
- What kinda bullshit is this?

613
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:18,792
You people must be out your damn mind.

614
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:20,203
You were in the Sphinx club?

615
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:21,903
My uncle used to tend bar over there.

616
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,690
Marvin Thompson?
Short guy...

617
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:25,200
What is your name, Officer?

618
00:32:26,408 --> 00:32:27,702
Detective Sydnor, sir.

619
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,702
Major Crimes?

620
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:35,702
Shit...

621
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:38,101
Enjoy your day, sir.

622
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:41,903
Son, we're gonna see about this.

623
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:58,000
Yankin' that bitch.

624
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,800
Son, that's too much knuckle.

625
00:33:13,206 --> 00:33:14,701
Why the fuck you keep callin' me?

626
00:33:14,808 --> 00:33:15,902
But what I say, though?

627
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,400
He got the message, fool.

628
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:19,000
Yo, Monk.
Who that, man?

629
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:21,000
Andre.
Old-Face Andre.

630
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:23,700
Here, let me holla at that dude.

631
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:26,091
Yo, check this out, man.

632
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:28,302
I'm gonna show you how you do this
right here, man.

633
00:33:29,405 --> 00:33:30,701
Don't rush me on shit.

634
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:33,103
I'll get at you when I'm at you.

635
00:33:38,907 --> 00:33:42,401
Yo, remember who you're talking to
before you say another fuckin' word.

636
00:33:50,306 --> 00:33:51,401
Andre, man.

637
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:54,403
Nigga need more maintenance
than both my babies' mama's.

638
00:33:58,308 --> 00:34:01,000
By accident.
It was accidental.

639
00:34:03,705 --> 00:34:05,603
And the mayor doesn't say anything?

640
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:07,803
I think he's pretty mad.

641
00:34:08,306 --> 00:34:10,303
I mean, Major,
I only took this detail

642
00:34:10,605 --> 00:34:12,401
to try and make sergeant on this list.

643
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,502
Kid, you made sergeant already.

644
00:34:15,707 --> 00:34:17,703
Shit, if Royce gets reelected,

645
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:21,201
you'll be a lieutenant in
2 years and a major in 4.

646
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,603
You go back down to the hall.

647
00:34:26,006 --> 00:34:27,703
You act like it never happened.

648
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,402
You shut up.

649
00:34:29,905 --> 00:34:31,303
Say nothing to no one.

650
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:33,003
But the mayor, he's gonna...

651
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:36,002
He's gonna watch and see
how you carry it.

652
00:34:36,805 --> 00:34:38,602
And kid, you're a fucking rock.

653
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:41,500
When the mayor looks in your face,

654
00:34:42,605 --> 00:34:44,502
he knows he can trust you with this.

655
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:48,200
And I'll bet in a couple of weeks,

656
00:34:49,106 --> 00:34:51,102
he comes asking,
real friendly-like,

657
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:53,500
what are you looking
to do with the department?

658
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:55,103
With your career?

659
00:34:55,608 --> 00:34:57,002
He's interested in you.

660
00:34:58,006 --> 00:34:59,992
But he doesn't mention no blowjob,

661
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:01,202
and neither do you.

662
00:35:01,508 --> 00:35:03,003
It just lays there

663
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:05,702
Like a bad pierogi on the plate.

664
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:08,700
Both of you pretending it ain't there.

665
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,000
What if he screws me over?

666
00:35:12,306 --> 00:35:14,001
Bounces me to a midnight shift?

667
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:16,102
He does that, you will talk.

668
00:35:24,308 --> 00:35:27,500
What I wouldn't give to be
in your shoes right now.

669
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:31,803
Kid, careers have been launched
on a hell of a lot less.

670
00:35:32,808 --> 00:35:33,903
Just,

671
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,502
shut up and play dumb.

672
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:40,803
I can do that.
No problem.

673
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:43,800
Thanks, Major.

674
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,403
Thanks for taking the time
to meet me on this.

675
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:49,602
I mean, it's a weight off
my mind talking to you.

676
00:35:49,806 --> 00:35:50,900
It really is.

677
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:52,403
Don't mention it.

678
00:35:53,205 --> 00:35:55,493
Maybe you get
a chance to do me a turn

679
00:35:55,505 --> 00:35:57,601
one day after
you make rank, huh?

680
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:02,702
Oh, boy.

681
00:36:07,108 --> 00:36:08,500
It's all good, Carv.

682
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:16,290
Because if some federal motherfucker
comes through the door,

683
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:18,301
I say, hey, it's all in the game.

684
00:36:18,806 --> 00:36:20,202
But a city police?

685
00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:21,800
Baltimore city?

686
00:36:22,006 --> 00:36:24,102
Hell, no.
Can't be happenin',

687
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:27,103
'cause I know I have raised
too much goddamn money

688
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:28,500
for the mayor and his ticket.

689
00:36:28,705 --> 00:36:29,790
Hell, no!

690
00:36:29,806 --> 00:36:32,601
Ain't no soul in the world
that fuckin' ungrateful!

691
00:36:34,806 --> 00:36:37,190
- Calm down, Clay, hum?
- Money laundering?

692
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:40,001
They gonna come talk to me
about money laundering?

693
00:36:40,107 --> 00:36:41,491
In West Baltimore?

694
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:42,702
Shit...

695
00:36:42,805 --> 00:36:46,103
where do y'all think I'm gonna
raise cash for the whole damn ticket?

696
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:48,200
From laundromats and shit?

697
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:51,002
From some tiny ass
Korean groceries?

698
00:36:51,906 --> 00:36:55,793
You think I have time to ask a man
why he givin' me money?

699
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:57,301
Or where he gets his money from?

700
00:36:57,705 --> 00:37:00,303
I'll take any motherfucker's money
if he givin't away.

701
00:37:00,406 --> 00:37:01,492
I don't wanna know.

702
00:37:01,508 --> 00:37:02,901
I know you don't wanna know.

703
00:37:03,008 --> 00:37:06,103
But I'm scratchin' an' clawin'
to get it done for you, Clarence.

704
00:37:06,206 --> 00:37:08,703
For you and me
and the rest of the team.

705
00:37:08,808 --> 00:37:11,900
And who comes through my door
but a Baltimore city police

706
00:37:11,806 --> 00:37:13,702
lookin' to get up
into my shit about it.

707
00:37:13,805 --> 00:37:15,093
Clay, we didn't know about that.

708
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:16,993
I'm sorry,
I gots to leave up out of here

709
00:37:17,005 --> 00:37:18,703
before I lose my damn mind.

710
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:20,100
Nobody knew about that.

711
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:23,501
You want to run a campaign
with my money pillowed under your ass,

712
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,202
you need your people
to back the fuck up, Clarence.

713
00:37:31,808 --> 00:37:33,103
Krawczyk's on line 1.

714
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:36,003
I'll jump on Burrell
and Demper both.

715
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:39,103
- Find out what the hell's going on.
- Wait, wait a minute.

716
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:43,402
That new driver,
the bald-headed, white kid.

717
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:45,200
Where did he come here from?

718
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,403
Hoskins brought him in, I think.

719
00:37:47,507 --> 00:37:48,501
Hoskins?

720
00:37:49,306 --> 00:37:51,903
He doesn't have a better rabbi
in the department than that?

721
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:53,303
Why, you want to lose him?

722
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,303
Let me think about it.

723
00:38:08,908 --> 00:38:11,203
Yeah, man, Officer Walker
be shady like that.

724
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:12,701
Police be stealin', yo.

725
00:38:12,806 --> 00:38:15,602
Yo, what I really wanna
get is a bubble Caprice.

726
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:17,402
I seen a nice one, too.

727
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:19,802
94 Caprice on 22's.

728
00:38:20,408 --> 00:38:22,202
- Shit was tight.
- You better be careful.

729
00:38:22,507 --> 00:38:23,693
They almost caught you today.

730
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:25,202
Nigga, they ain't almost caught shit.

731
00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:26,400
Be quiet, y'all.

732
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:28,303
Y'all know who I am, right?

733
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,403
Carver.
You a knockos.

734
00:38:31,106 --> 00:38:32,302
Today I'm auto theft.

735
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:35,500
Fair warning.

736
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:39,900
If I see any of y'all little hoppers
even smile at a motor vehicle again,

737
00:38:40,006 --> 00:38:41,900
it ain't gonna be
no juvenile hearing.

738
00:38:42,008 --> 00:38:44,600
No, it's gonna be my people
settlin' up with y'all in the alleys.

739
00:38:44,707 --> 00:38:46,447
- You understand?
- You can't do that, yo.

740
00:38:46,506 --> 00:38:47,602
Try me, Namond.

741
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,601
Yeah, that's right.
I know your name.

742
00:38:50,107 --> 00:38:51,303
I know where you live.

743
00:38:51,905 --> 00:38:53,403
And I know where y'all hang.

744
00:39:08,705 --> 00:39:12,301
Damn, yo!
Nice ride.

745
00:39:14,808 --> 00:39:15,801
Hey, Bunk.

746
00:39:17,206 --> 00:39:19,002
You have any luck
finding your shooter?

747
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:20,803
Naw.
He's runnin'.

748
00:39:21,308 --> 00:39:23,500
But at least I know
who my shooter is, right?

749
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:25,100
I just got to find the boy.

750
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:27,102
- Family won't go for nothin'?
- Nah.

751
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:29,100
Mother wouldn't say shit.

752
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:31,601
But it wasn't the usual way
a mama lies.

753
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:33,703
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

754
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:37,390
It was a weird vibe, man.
I can't explain it.

755
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:40,202
It was like she was off
somewhere else in her head.

756
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:44,003
Line 4.
Communication.

757
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,403
- Who's up?
- I'm up. I'll take it.

758
00:39:47,608 --> 00:39:48,703
No, wait.

759
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:50,901
If it's yours, you lucky bitch,

760
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,803
then it's a domestic
in a house with 4 wits.

761
00:39:53,906 --> 00:39:54,992
You want the call?

762
00:39:55,007 --> 00:39:57,503
But I pick up that phone,
do I make it unlucky?

763
00:39:57,907 --> 00:39:59,002
Or is it
still your call?

764
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:01,500
You want the call, pick it up.

765
00:40:02,006 --> 00:40:03,702
If you don't, don't.

766
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:07,602
Homicide.
Norris.

767
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:09,502
Right.

768
00:40:11,507 --> 00:40:12,503
I got it.

769
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:15,991
1400 Lanvale.

770
00:40:16,008 --> 00:40:18,392
In the street.
Found by the post officer.

771
00:40:18,408 --> 00:40:20,002
No suspects,
no witnesses.

772
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:25,602
Ah, man.

773
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:31,001
Better to be lucky than to be good.

774
00:40:34,406 --> 00:40:36,102
You wanna work the heavy bag?

775
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:39,502
G'head. 4 rounds.

776
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:55,492
Hey.

777
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:57,100
- Hey.
- I'm Gail.

778
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:59,001
I made this for you
and the other men,

779
00:40:59,105 --> 00:41:01,103
to let you know
you're appreciated.

780
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:02,501
That's real nice.

781
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:04,102
Peach cobbler.

782
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:06,402
I'm sorry,
I forgot whose mother you are.

783
00:41:06,607 --> 00:41:07,793
Oh, I don't have any boys.

784
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:09,690
I just appreciate
what you been doing.

785
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:10,800
You and the other coaches.

786
00:41:10,906 --> 00:41:11,992
Volunteering and all.

787
00:41:12,008 --> 00:41:13,700
Well, thank you, that's real nice.

788
00:41:13,907 --> 00:41:15,090
I got 3 girls.

789
00:41:15,107 --> 00:41:16,793
Y'all don't teach girls, though, do you?

790
00:41:16,805 --> 00:41:19,202
No, I'm real old-fashioned
about that.

791
00:41:19,305 --> 00:41:20,503
Oh, I agree wit' you.

792
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:23,102
Men should be men
and women should be women.

793
00:41:23,207 --> 00:41:24,501
That's what I think.

794
00:41:30,707 --> 00:41:33,203
Single wound,
upper back, no casings,

795
00:41:33,308 --> 00:41:35,100
no witnesses,
and nothing on the canvas.

796
00:41:35,305 --> 00:41:36,403
Dead when you got here?

797
00:41:36,505 --> 00:41:37,601
Actually not.

798
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:40,102
He was still conscious
and coughin' blood when I pulled up.

799
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,201
You ask who shot him?

800
00:41:41,306 --> 00:41:42,500
Yeah, I asked who shot him.

801
00:41:42,606 --> 00:41:44,403
He said it was a guy with a gun.

802
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:53,702
<i>Yo, why you keep calling?</i>

803
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:55,403
<i>He got the message, fool.</i>

804
00:41:55,706 --> 00:41:57,003
<i>Yo, Monk, who that, man?</i>

805
00:41:57,108 --> 00:41:59,203
<i>Andre.</i>
<i>Old-face Andre.</i>

806
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:02,301
<i>Yo, Monk,</i>
<i>who that, man?</i>

807
00:42:02,206 --> 00:42:04,801
<i>Andre.</i>
<i>Old-face Andre.</i>

808
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:07,103
Lemme key that.

809
00:42:08,508 --> 00:42:09,692
<i>Yo Monk.</i>
<i>Who that, man?</i>

810
00:42:09,706 --> 00:42:11,603
<i>Andre.</i>
<i>Old-face Andre.</i>

811
00:42:15,607 --> 00:42:16,900
<i>Yo, check this out, man.</i>

812
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:21,400
<i>Don't rush me on shit.</i>

813
00:42:22,008 --> 00:42:24,403
- <i>I'll get at you when I'm at you.</i>
- <i>I'm just saying...</i>

814
00:42:27,806 --> 00:42:28,903
Ol' face Andre.

815
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,392
Tryin' to reup with Monk Metcalf.

816
00:42:30,408 --> 00:42:32,703
Yeah, well, Monk took
the call on his cellphone.

817
00:42:32,808 --> 00:42:34,490
But that second voice ranked him.

818
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:35,991
Ranked everybody, by the sound of it.

819
00:42:36,008 --> 00:42:38,203
Marlo Stanfield.
On the phone.

820
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,200
The way he shut that call down,
I'd say yeah. That was him.

821
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,846
Yeah, but what was all that
in the background? Fireworks, or?

822
00:42:43,906 --> 00:42:45,403
Naw, it was regular intervals.

823
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:46,701
Semi-auto from the sound.

824
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:48,202
Target practice, maybe.

825
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:50,503
Either that or a firing squad.

826
00:42:50,808 --> 00:42:54,200
There are no bodies
on this guy in months,

827
00:42:54,808 --> 00:42:57,603
but we get him on the phone
and it sounds like a war zone.

828
00:42:57,805 --> 00:42:59,992
Well, at least he gets
on a phone now and then.

829
00:43:00,005 --> 00:43:01,101
That's something.

830
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:02,803
Sounds arrogant, doesn't he?

831
00:43:03,005 --> 00:43:04,903
Like he's the lil' king of everything.

832
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,603
Ah, youth.

833
00:43:22,306 --> 00:43:23,302
Yo, Bubs.

834
00:43:26,706 --> 00:43:27,900
Thought you asleep.

835
00:43:29,508 --> 00:43:30,803
If you want...

836
00:43:32,505 --> 00:43:34,101
I could go to school some.

837
00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:40,603
I ain't been for a while,
so I don't even know if I can.

838
00:43:42,608 --> 00:43:44,202
But if you
want me to go...

839
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:46,601
ain't no thing.

840
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:36,603
His honor was mad?

841
00:44:37,705 --> 00:44:39,593
I can't begin to describe it.

842
00:44:39,605 --> 00:44:40,800
What's he want from us?

843
00:44:40,905 --> 00:44:42,200
To block the subpoenas,

844
00:44:42,705 --> 00:44:45,201
but he knows we can't
once those things go out.

845
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:47,301
What I could promise him

846
00:44:47,806 --> 00:44:50,500
is no more surprises out of our shop.

847
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:53,901
- Is this that cocksucker McNulty?
- Not this time.

848
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:55,902
He's been gone
from that unit a year.

849
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:59,801
My best guess
would be Lester Freamon.

850
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:01,201
Freamon?

851
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:02,600
Lester's got a helluva game.

852
00:45:02,705 --> 00:45:04,501
Well, we need to sit on
the motherfucker.

853
00:45:04,605 --> 00:45:07,602
All that unit needs, Commissioner,
is proper supervision.

854
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:13,602
Hey, the State of Maryland
just lost another cooperating witness,

855
00:45:13,807 --> 00:45:15,801
and I just found a lot
of fucking overtime.

856
00:45:16,007 --> 00:45:18,303
This case went from
who gives a fuck drug murder

857
00:45:18,406 --> 00:45:19,802
to straight-up red ball.

858
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:27,001
Fuck,
I should've picked up that phone.

859
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:31,902
Hey, sarge.
My boy's a witness.

860
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:33,601
Drug case pending in part 18.

861
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:36,003
You know for sure
he's killed for that reason?

862
00:45:36,106 --> 00:45:37,103
Don't know shit.

863
00:45:37,205 --> 00:45:40,391
But from the look of the court computer,
This guy's the state's whole case.

864
00:45:40,408 --> 00:45:42,603
Don't put it in the 24
that the guy was a witness.

865
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:46,000
Trust me, we do not wanna
kick shit in an election year.

866
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:47,702
Work the case,
take the O.T.,

867
00:45:47,806 --> 00:45:50,302
but bury the witness angle
'til we know for sure.

868
00:45:52,808 --> 00:45:54,202
And close the door.

869
00:46:09,405 --> 00:46:10,403
Yeah.

870
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:12,301
It's Landsman.
Homicide.

871
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:14,300
Is the Major in this morning?

872
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:17,003
Next order of business:
class rules.

873
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,100
It helps if the team
is constant on these.

874
00:46:19,205 --> 00:46:20,801
Less giggle room for the children.

875
00:46:21,307 --> 00:46:22,303
Mrs. Scott?

876
00:46:22,508 --> 00:46:24,202
Same as last year, double space.

877
00:46:24,308 --> 00:46:26,601
Language arts,
we grade a lot of papers.

878
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:29,490
It doesn't make them write any better
but it saves my eyesight.

879
00:46:29,508 --> 00:46:31,191
Make sure you
demonstrate it for them.

880
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:34,201
Some of them think double space
means more space between words.

881
00:46:34,305 --> 00:46:35,703
I'd of thought by eighth grade...

882
00:46:35,805 --> 00:46:37,890
Rule of thumb around here,
Mr. Pryzbylewski:

883
00:46:37,906 --> 00:46:38,991
never assume.

884
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:40,501
Explain what you want them to do,

885
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:42,400
have them do it,
then explain again.

886
00:46:42,705 --> 00:46:44,803
With time and patience,
they'll get it.

887
00:46:44,908 --> 00:46:45,903
Mrs. Shapiro?

888
00:46:46,008 --> 00:46:49,700
It's easier to keep track of lab work
if we all use the same heading.

889
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:52,790
Upper right hand corner,
above the first blue line:

890
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:55,500
name, date, and class number,
in that order?

891
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:58,790
Mr. Pryzbylewski, do you have anything
you want addressed?

892
00:46:58,805 --> 00:47:00,503
Can we have them not chew gum?

893
00:47:01,608 --> 00:47:03,300
They won't do it in
Ms. Sampson's class,

894
00:47:03,406 --> 00:47:05,903
but in 4 years,
I have not been able to stop them.

895
00:47:06,006 --> 00:47:08,791
You can try, but first year,
it's best to stick with basics.

896
00:47:08,806 --> 00:47:11,901
And team rules, we can only go
with what we can all enforce.

897
00:47:12,407 --> 00:47:14,201
Also, keep your windows closed.

898
00:47:14,807 --> 00:47:17,100
Makes them drowsy,
and drowsy's good.

899
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:19,702
There's a lot to learn.
But for now,

900
00:47:19,905 --> 00:47:22,091
build in lots of activities
in your lesson plan.

901
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,201
You can't
have enough.

902
00:47:23,305 --> 00:47:25,702
You keep them busy,
you keep them off guard.

903
00:47:29,908 --> 00:47:31,602
You need soft eyes.

904
00:47:32,906 --> 00:47:34,001
Excuse me?

905
00:47:37,707 --> 00:47:39,190
Yeah, but that doesn't prevent you

906
00:47:39,207 --> 00:47:41,390
from giving more
under your wife's name,

907
00:47:41,406 --> 00:47:44,100
your children, if they
got separate accounts... yeah.

908
00:47:46,105 --> 00:47:48,102
Sorry, Richie,
can you hold a moment?

909
00:47:49,005 --> 00:47:52,093
Your buddy from the F.O.P.
and he says it's important.

910
00:47:52,105 --> 00:47:53,201
Hey, Stan.

911
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:56,101
I'm a little busy
losing an election here.

912
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:58,901
You remember about 6 months ago,

913
00:47:59,008 --> 00:48:02,401
you told me to keep an eye for
any witnesses gettin' clipped?

914
00:48:02,606 --> 00:48:03,901
You remember that?

915
00:48:06,006 --> 00:48:07,703
Who's better than me, Tommy?

916
00:48:10,405 --> 00:48:12,201
Hey, Richie, can I call you back?

917
00:48:13,106 --> 00:48:14,102
Thanks.

918
00:48:19,805 --> 00:48:21,800
Anything else you want me
to do, Miss Donnelly?

919
00:48:23,505 --> 00:48:25,501
You live near Duquan Weems, correct?

920
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:26,603
Dukie?

921
00:48:27,508 --> 00:48:29,301
I want you to take this to his house.

922
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:31,193
Them clothes won't stay clean long.

923
00:48:31,205 --> 00:48:33,392
Make sure you deliver
them just to Duquan.

924
00:48:33,408 --> 00:48:34,892
Not any of the adults in the house.

925
00:48:34,906 --> 00:48:35,992
Just Duquan.

926
00:48:36,005 --> 00:48:38,059
- Want me to do it tonight?
- That would be great.

927
00:48:38,107 --> 00:48:39,402
And, Crystal, thanks for today.

928
00:48:39,506 --> 00:48:41,000
You're welcome, Miss Donnelly.

929
00:48:42,305 --> 00:48:43,802
- Can I help you?
- Yes, ma'am.

930
00:48:43,907 --> 00:48:46,092
This young man has to be
registered for school.

931
00:48:46,108 --> 00:48:47,290
Does he attend here?

932
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:48,502
He should.

933
00:48:48,805 --> 00:48:49,790
What I mean is,

934
00:48:49,806 --> 00:48:51,903
what grade were you
in last year, dear?

935
00:48:53,607 --> 00:48:55,600
He kinda lost his way some time ago.

936
00:48:55,706 --> 00:48:57,002
He's livin' with me now.

937
00:48:57,205 --> 00:48:58,193
And you are his...

938
00:48:58,206 --> 00:48:59,800
uncle.
I'm his uncle.

939
00:49:01,907 --> 00:49:03,101
Come into my office.

940
00:49:10,706 --> 00:49:11,802
Thank you.

941
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,803
Yo, look at coach workin' it, yo.

942
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,401
A'ight, man, break.

943
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:39,102
That's what I like to see, baby.

944
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:41,391
You gotta use that left
a little more, though, a'ight.

945
00:49:41,407 --> 00:49:42,702
Yo, man, you finished?

946
00:49:43,607 --> 00:49:44,702
Got another 2 minutes.

947
00:49:44,746 --> 00:49:46,120
Fuck that, I got a fight coming up.

948
00:49:46,143 --> 00:49:47,490
You can come back later, a'ight?

949
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,220
Yo, man said he got
1 more round, a'ight?

950
00:49:49,255 --> 00:49:50,288
Step aside, young'un.

951
00:49:50,307 --> 00:49:53,102
Naw, man, bag is mine for 4 rounds
and I only did 3.

952
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:54,200
Fuck that man.

953
00:49:55,444 --> 00:49:56,790
What the fuck u tryin' to prove?

954
00:49:56,808 --> 00:49:58,793
Come on, man,
come on. Come on.

955
00:49:58,805 --> 00:49:59,790
What's going on, boy?

956
00:49:59,806 --> 00:50:02,391
I got a fight Saturday night,
an' the boy won't get off the bag.

957
00:50:02,405 --> 00:50:04,101
What the fuck he on
the bag for anyway?

958
00:50:04,206 --> 00:50:06,001
He don't even fight.
He don't even spar.

959
00:50:06,105 --> 00:50:07,303
Spar with your ass any day.

960
00:50:07,408 --> 00:50:08,792
- Come on, then.
- Hey, hey, hey.

961
00:50:08,808 --> 00:50:10,292
Y'all be cool, you hear me?

962
00:50:10,306 --> 00:50:12,200
I ain't putting up
with this foolishness.

963
00:50:12,606 --> 00:50:13,703
Come here, Michael.

964
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:16,390
I can work the bag now, right?

965
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:17,602
Not yet.
Just wait.

966
00:50:17,906 --> 00:50:20,200
- You said 4 rounds.
- Yeah, I know what I said.

967
00:50:20,707 --> 00:50:23,101
You finish up your rounds,
and then Justin gets on.

968
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:25,402
I don't want hear
no more street talk.

969
00:50:25,506 --> 00:50:27,502
We boxin' up in here,
we ain't fightin'.

970
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:30,090
He wanna get in the ring with me,
we can go.

971
00:50:30,106 --> 00:50:31,301
Look here,
look here,

972
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:32,890
let me tell you something.

973
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:35,203
You can come here, work out,
use the equipment.

974
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:38,103
But nobody gets in that ring
unless they're being trained.

975
00:50:38,507 --> 00:50:39,703
You wanna be trained?

976
00:50:42,008 --> 00:50:43,501
I've been watching you hit that bag.

977
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:45,103
You got a natural right hand.

978
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,201
The way you throw it,
the way you land it.

979
00:50:47,507 --> 00:50:50,193
Now, if I was to train you,
we'd have to start with floor work.

980
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:52,002
'Cause see, if you
don't know how to move,

981
00:50:52,107 --> 00:50:54,301
you ain't got no business
being in that ring.

982
00:50:55,008 --> 00:50:56,302
So what you think?

983
00:50:56,707 --> 00:50:58,901
I'd train you myself, personally.

984
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:05,003
Nah, really I just wanna keep
doing what I been doing.

985
00:51:05,306 --> 00:51:06,300
All right.

986
00:51:13,307 --> 00:51:14,400
Let's see that right.

987
00:51:29,605 --> 00:51:30,700
Is Dukie here?

988
00:51:31,405 --> 00:51:32,500
What's that?

989
00:51:32,705 --> 00:51:34,202
That's for Duquan, right?

990
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:35,601
I take it to him.

991
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:38,101
Gimme.

992
00:51:38,605 --> 00:51:39,801
Hey, Crystal.

993
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,503
Miss Donnelly said to give you these.

994
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,203
OK. I'll be right down.

995
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:48,101
What?

996
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,503
<i>And for either of</i>
<i>my opponents to suggest</i>

997
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,202
<i>that downtown development</i>
<i>comes at the expense</i>

998
00:51:54,305 --> 00:51:56,102
<i>of our city's neighborhoods,</i>

999
00:51:56,207 --> 00:51:59,802
<i>well, that's just unfair</i>
<i>and, uh, divisive.</i>

1000
00:52:00,306 --> 00:52:03,303
<i>For them to suggest</i>
<i>that my administration</i>

1001
00:52:03,608 --> 00:52:05,800
<i>has not been responsive, well...</i>

1002
00:52:06,607 --> 00:52:08,902
<i>Economic development</i>
<i>cannot be a band-aid.</i>

1003
00:52:09,005 --> 00:52:12,403
<i>It is a long-term process</i>
<i>that requires commitment</i>

1004
00:52:12,805 --> 00:52:15,691
<i>to retraining our workforce</i>
<i>and, as I said before,</i>

1005
00:52:15,707 --> 00:52:18,591
<i>this can only be successful</i>
<i>in a city where people feel safe.</i>

1006
00:52:18,606 --> 00:52:20,703
<i>So before we can even</i>
<i>begin to think about</i>

1007
00:52:20,806 --> 00:52:22,202
<i>luring new industries to Baltimore,</i>

1008
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:24,000
<i>we need to think</i>
<i>about how we can make</i>

1009
00:52:24,105 --> 00:52:27,000
<i>these neighborhoods and</i>
<i>this city safe once again.</i>

1010
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:29,790
Mr. Carcetti may think
it's in his interest

1011
00:52:29,807 --> 00:52:31,093
to exploit people's fears.

1012
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:33,803
He's been doing it
throughout this campaign.

1013
00:52:35,205 --> 00:52:36,501
I'm offended by it, personally.

1014
00:52:36,605 --> 00:52:38,002
But the fact is,

1015
00:52:38,108 --> 00:52:41,500
that violent crime
is down citywide,

1016
00:52:41,907 --> 00:52:44,501
and our police department
is working hard

1017
00:52:44,705 --> 00:52:45,800
to keep it that way...

1018
00:52:46,005 --> 00:52:48,602
and will continue to do so
under my administration.

1019
00:52:48,907 --> 00:52:50,103
Councilman Carcetti,

1020
00:52:50,205 --> 00:52:51,901
you have 2 minutes to respond.

1021
00:52:52,508 --> 00:52:55,800
Does anyone in this room really believe
that crime is down in Baltimore?

1022
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,203
You calling me a liar, Tommy?

1023
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:59,302
Gentleman, please.
No personal interactions.

1024
00:52:59,505 --> 00:53:00,603
Councilman Carcetti.

1025
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:02,201
Can the mayor honestly tell

1026
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:03,803
the people of Rosemont,

1027
00:53:04,205 --> 00:53:06,400
of Belair Edison,
of Highlandtown or Cherry Hill

1028
00:53:06,506 --> 00:53:09,202
there's less drug-dealing,
less violence?

1029
00:53:09,607 --> 00:53:11,891
Any statistics coming from
the police department

1030
00:53:11,906 --> 00:53:14,100
cannot be trusted,
because under this mayor,

1031
00:53:14,305 --> 00:53:17,400
the police are more concerned with
protecting Clarence Royce politically

1032
00:53:17,505 --> 00:53:18,801
than fighting crime.

1033
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:21,601
There's no leadership and morale
has never been lower.

1034
00:53:21,707 --> 00:53:22,602
I'll change that.

1035
00:53:23,005 --> 00:53:25,202
<i>It's business as usual</i>
<i>down at city hall</i>

1036
00:53:25,408 --> 00:53:28,102
<i>and as a result,</i>
<i>our response to crime</i>

1037
00:53:28,007 --> 00:53:30,200
<i>has been characterized time</i>
<i>and time again</i>

1038
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,801
<i>by wanton indifference.</i>

1039
00:53:32,805 --> 00:53:34,202
<i>32 yards!</i>

1040
00:53:34,807 --> 00:53:36,800
<i>What do I mean by business as usual?</i>

1041
00:53:37,707 --> 00:53:39,502
<i>What do I mean</i>
<i>by wanton indifference?</i>

1042
00:53:40,006 --> 00:53:42,201
<i>Well, last night in West Baltimore,</i>

1043
00:53:42,505 --> 00:53:43,803
<i>on Lanvale Street,</i>

1044
00:53:44,406 --> 00:53:46,303
<i>another citizen was shot and killed.</i>

1045
00:53:47,005 --> 00:53:48,801
<i>This time, the victim</i>
<i>was a key witness</i>

1046
00:53:48,908 --> 00:53:50,790
<i>in a drug case that had yet</i>
<i>to come to court.</i>

1047
00:53:50,808 --> 00:53:53,992
<i>Courageously,</i>
<i>this man had agreed to testify</i>

1048
00:53:54,007 --> 00:53:55,700
<i>in 2 weeks time in that case.</i>

1049
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,700
<i>The police should have</i>
<i>been protecting him.</i>

1050
00:53:57,807 --> 00:53:59,901
<i>They were not,</i>
<i>and he was murdered.</i>

1051
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:02,401
- Oh, shit.
- <i>Why?</i>

1052
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:03,893
You're primetime, Eddie.

1053
00:54:03,906 --> 00:54:06,101
<i>would not spend the money</i>
<i>to protect him.</i>

1054
00:54:06,408 --> 00:54:08,490
<i>Now I have no doubt</i>
<i>that in a moment or two</i>

1055
00:54:08,506 --> 00:54:10,492
<i>Clarence Royce will accuse me</i>
<i>of exploiting</i>

1056
00:54:10,508 --> 00:54:12,793
<i>this man's death for</i>
<i>my own political purpose.</i>

1057
00:54:12,807 --> 00:54:14,302
<i>But the truth is,</i>

1058
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:16,101
<i>a year ago</i>

1059
00:54:16,307 --> 00:54:17,701
I wrote the mayor a letter.

1060
00:54:17,808 --> 00:54:19,490
I have copies for
anyone who wants one.

1061
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:23,693
I begged him to spend the money
and make witness protection a priority.

1062
00:54:23,706 --> 00:54:25,001
He ignored me.

1063
00:54:25,106 --> 00:54:27,103
I even teamed up with our
legislative leaders...

1064
00:54:27,206 --> 00:54:28,602
delegate Watkins and others...

1065
00:54:28,707 --> 00:54:31,791
to get matching funds for witness
protection approved in Annapolis.

1066
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:33,902
And incredibly
those matching funds

1067
00:54:34,008 --> 00:54:35,892
were never claimed by
this administration.

1068
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:38,193
Now to mention this now
may be exploitive,

1069
00:54:38,206 --> 00:54:40,500
I don't know,
I only know it's true.

1070
00:54:40,705 --> 00:54:42,101
And on such truths,

1071
00:54:42,307 --> 00:54:45,201
I ask the voters of our city
to consider a change.

1072
00:54:50,008 --> 00:54:51,502
Folks, please, please,

1073
00:54:51,606 --> 00:54:54,602
<i>hold your applause until</i>
<i>after the round of questions is over.</i>

1074
00:54:54,707 --> 00:54:55,701
<i>Mayor Royce?</i>

1075
00:54:55,808 --> 00:54:57,302
No more surprises, huh?

1076
00:54:58,606 --> 00:55:02,701
<i>Well, I am unaware of</i>
<i>the specifics of the incident</i>

1077
00:55:02,805 --> 00:55:04,901
<i>to which Councilman</i>
<i>Carcetti is referring,</i>

1078
00:55:05,008 --> 00:55:08,000
<i>Uh, so I can't answer</i>
<i>that directly...</i>

1079
00:55:08,205 --> 00:55:10,800
<i>However, I can say that this city</i>

1080
00:55:11,406 --> 00:55:15,700
<i>places the highest priority</i>
<i>on protecting those citizens</i>

1081
00:55:15,806 --> 00:55:17,393
<i>who come forward to testify,</i>

1082
00:55:17,406 --> 00:55:19,501
<i>and we will continue to do so.</i>

1083
00:55:20,307 --> 00:55:24,192
<i>Mr. Carcetti...</i>
<i>states that he wrote a letter</i>

1084
00:55:24,206 --> 00:55:27,190
<i>expressing his concerns,</i>
<i>and I'm sure that he did.</i>

1085
00:55:27,207 --> 00:55:28,301
<i>I mean it's... it's...</i>

1086
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,192
<i>it's easy enough to write letters</i>

1087
00:55:30,206 --> 00:55:32,503
<i>when all you have to do</i>
<i>is write letters.</i>

1088
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,802
But,
when you are required

1089
00:55:36,306 --> 00:55:37,803
to run a city

1090
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:41,001
on limited resources,

1091
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:43,802
and balance priorities,

1092
00:55:44,005 --> 00:55:46,900
well, then...
well, then you understand

1093
00:55:47,005 --> 00:55:49,903
that writing letters
will not solve the problem.

1094
00:55:50,106 --> 00:55:51,201
Oh, no...

1095
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,403
Shit, girl.

1096
00:55:55,307 --> 00:55:57,102
You know I'm-a roll wit' you.

1097
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,701
I need some kinda break...

1098
00:56:19,705 --> 00:56:21,203
Oh, shit...

1099
00:56:34,507 --> 00:56:36,293
...ain't nothin' worse
than them bitches

1100
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:39,303
with fucked up nails
at the blackjack table...

1101
00:56:40,506 --> 00:56:41,900
You know?

1102
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:44,602
Hold on.

1103
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:49,801
You think my son ain't gonna go up
to that school lookin' like himself?

1104
00:56:55,505 --> 00:56:57,600
<i>And I don't believe</i>
<i>we can get a handle on crime</i>

1105
